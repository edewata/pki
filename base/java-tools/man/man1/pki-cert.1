.SH OPTIONS
The CLI options are described in \fBpki\fR(1).

.SH OPERATIONS
To view available certificate commands, type \fBpki <subsystem>-cert\fP. To view each command's usage, type \fB pki <subsystem>-cert-<command> --help\fP.

.SS Viewing Certificates
Certificates can be viewed anonymously.

To list all certificates in the CA:

.B pki ca-cert-find

It is also possible to search for and list specific certificates by adding a search filter.  Use \fBpki ca-cert-find \-\-help\fP to see options.  For example, to search based on issuance date:

.B pki ca-cert-find --issuedOnFrom 2012-06-15

To view a particular certificate:

.B pki ca-cert-show <certificate ID>

.SS Revoking Certificates
Revoking, holding, or releasing a certificate must be executed as an agent user.
To revoke a certificate:

.B pki <agent authentication> ca-cert-revoke <certificate ID>

To place a certificate on hold temporarily:

.B pki <agent authentication> ca-cert-hold <certificate ID>

To release a certificate that has been placed on hold:

.B pki <agent authentication> ca-cert-release-hold <certificate ID>

.SS Certificate Requests
To request a certificate, first generate a certificate request in PKCS #10 or CRMF, and store this request in the XML template file, of the profile type the request relates to.

The list of profiles can be viewed using the CLI command:

.B pki ca-cert-request-profile-find

The XML template file for a profile type can be created by calling the ca-cert-request-profile-show CLI command. For example:

\fBpki ca-cert-request-profile-show <profileID> \-\-output <file to store the XML template>\fP

will store the XML template of the request in the specified output file.

Then, fill in the values in the XML file and submit the request for review.  This can be done without authentication.

.B pki ca-cert-request-submit <request file>

Then, an agent needs to review the request by running the following command:

.B pki <agent authentication> ca-cert-request-review <request ID> --file <file to store the certificate request>

The \-\-file <filename> and \-\-action <action> options are mutually exclusive (i. e. - only one or the other may be specified during command invocation).

If the \-\-file <filename> option is specified, the certificate request, as well as the defaults and constraints of the enrollment profile, will be retrieved and stored in the output file provided by the \-\-file option.  The agent can examine the file and override any values if necessary.  To process the request, enter the appropriate action when prompted:

.B Action (approve/reject/cancel/update/validate/assign/unassign):

The request in the file will be read in, and the specified action will be applied against it.

Alternatively, when no changes to the request are necessary, the agent can process the request in a single step using the --action <action> option with the following command:

.B pki <agent authentication> ca-cert-request-review <request ID> --action <action>
