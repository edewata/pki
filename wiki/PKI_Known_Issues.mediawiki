We are doing integration of PSG box with RHEL4.0 Certificate System7.3.
RHEL CS supports LunaSA by default but for other PKCS#11 h/w we have to add h/w module using the modutil utility.

The PSG h/w module is successfully added using the modutil, still it is not listing in install wizard of CA's key store panel.
Any help will be appriciated.....
