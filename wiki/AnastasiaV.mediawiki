Hi! My name is Lela Koch, I'm excited about getting aboard for this project. I've been out of work for nearly 4 years, and I need to practice my typing and editing skills, or I'll never be able to get back into the workforce. I'm looking forward to forcing my brain to work again. Since I'm kind of new around here, I'd seriously appreciate feedback on whatever I accidentally screw up. I don't really know how that's done, but I'm sure I'll get it eventually.
