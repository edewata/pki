= Debug Log =

In PKI 9 Server the debug logs are stored in /var/log/pki-<subsystem>/debug.

The logging configuration is stored in /var/lib/pki-<subsystem>/conf/CS.cfg:

<pre>
debug.append=true
debug.enabled=true
debug.filename=/var/lib/pki-<subsystem>/logs/ca/debug
debug.hashkeytypes=
debug.level=10
debug.showcaller=false
</pre>

Log levels:
* most detailed: 0
* least detailed: 10

On Fedora the default level is 0. On RHEL the default level is 10.

The server must be restarted for the changes to become effective.

== Pre-Installation ==

To change the debug level prior to running the installation, change the CS.cfg template in /usr/share/pki/<subsystem>/conf.

== Post-Installation ==

To change the debug level after the installation is complete, change the CS.cfg in /var/lib/pki-<subsystem>/conf.
