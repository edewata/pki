= Overview =

This page describes the process to configure CRL.

= Pre-Install Configuration =

== Enabling/Disabling CRL ==

CRL is enabled by default. To disable CRL specify the following parameter in pkispawn configuration file:

 [CA]
 pki_master_crl_enable=False

== Configuring CRL number ==

The following parameter can be added into pkispawn config file:

 [CA]
 pki_ca_starting_crl_number=4000

Here 4000 is just an example. If this is set, after CA installation, the value of "crlNumber" in the db will be
set to "4000" as selected instead of 1.

If there is no setting made, the current default behavior will happen. In this case the "crlNumber" will end up being set to "1" as normal.

= Post-Install Configuration =
