Hi!  My name is Christy Hess, I'm very excited about joining in for this wiki. I've been unemployed for nearly 4 years now, and I need to keep up my writing and editing skills, or I won't ever be able to get back to work. I'm looking forward to getting my brain moving again. Since I'm still kind of new here, I would honestly appreciate feedback on whatever I might bungle. I guess you can add things here and I'll see it?  I'll get the hang of it after a bit.
