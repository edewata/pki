The actual answer to any issue related to snoring will be the width in your throat. Basically, the size of one's throat can alter.

A person who snores not merely disturbs the sleep of others. He could harm their hearing. This was revealed by Mark Bricklin, executive editor of Prevention magazine, who said that a snorer sounds for example a "yammering jackhammer" or perhaps a "ringing alarm clock."

How significantly noise does a snorer make? Bricklin said the rumbling reaches an average of 80 decibels for an eight-hour period of sleep. This figure exceeds the US Environmental Protection Agency common for noise pollution and could possibly truly impair hearing.
