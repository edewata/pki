Suzuki APV Car Market in Indonesia

Because the humble white van grows ever more complicated - and well equipped - it?s good to find out one or more option exists that?ll perform the job having to break the financial institution. 

That option is [http://mobilsuzukiterbaru.com/suzuki-apv-adalah-pilihan-tepat-untuk-kendaraan-keluarga-anda/ Suzuki APV]: a no-frills commercial carrier featuring simple mechanicals (in a familiar layout), capacious load capacity and also a barebones interior, all targeted at obtaining the task finished for a minimum of fuss.

Measuring approximately four metres in length, and little over 1.5 metres wide, Suzuki?s APV helps to make the a majority of its pocket-sized exterior by stretching nearly vertical at each and every side to create an empty, box-like interior. The recompense is a cargo area of 3.4 cubic metres offering a toned floor, accessibility by having a door each and every side plus a large, top-hinged rear hatch. It?s worth noting, however, the side doors are hinged, not sliding like many vans, that can make unloading in tight spots a tad difficult.

Best often considered as a light-duty lugger, APV would ideally suit inner-urban parcel carriers, franchisee handymen, gardeners, or any small business owner to whom highway travel is an occasional requirement. Though official payload numbers are difficult to find, the APV, which has a several passengers agreeable, can perform hauling around 600kg (total payload including passengers is 810kg).

The interior is barebones basic, and greets both driver and passenger with plenty accommodation and ideal visibility, but hardly anything else. A non-adjustable urethane tyre and thinly padded vinyl seats mean determining the right driving position is a compromise, while the mix off an intrusive wheel well, low door aperture and deficit of driver?s side grab handle make clambering in an impression gymnastic. Shorter drivers may even find their shin strikes the dashboard when depressing the clutch.

Engine heat, too, is transferred on the cabin with little resistance, but is countered by an acceptable HVAC system with manually-operated air conditioner. A vinyl curtain behind the driver?s compartment would do a lot in keeping the cabin cooler. Road noise is additionally a dilemma with 86db recorded at 100km/h. Enhance the lightweight (1140kg), slab-sided van?s inclination towards cross winds and it?s simple to grasp why it's best thought of as an urban proposition. 

Feature wise, APV gives an after-market (Clarion) CD/tuner with two speakers, 3.5mm and USB input and removable face (but no Bluetooth), engine immobiliser, 12V power outlet, rear demister and rudimentary instrumentation with analogue temperature, fuel, odometer and speed displays (no tachometer). 

Storage is again minimal by using a small oddments tray fore with the gearshift as well as a glovebox a common options. There are no cup holders to speak of.

Windows and mirrors and adjusted manually, out of the box the central locking, which we must note neglected to operate a back corner left-hand door. APV offers one interior light which illuminates the driver?s cabin but is not the cargo area, a shame considering the car?s commercial orientation. 

Safety comes by way of three-point inertia reel seatbelts with pretensioners, driver and passenger head restraints and dual front airbags. The seatbelts will not be adjustable for shoulder height. APV is not offered with anti-lock brakes, stability control, traction control, cruise control, side or curtain airbags. It achieved a three-star ANCAP safety rating scoring 7.54 out from a possible 16 points in the common frontal offset collision make sure a generally reaction of 23.54 at a possible 37 points.

On the plus side, the APV can be a cinch to drive a car easy to manoeuvre in tight spaces. The hydraulically-assisted rack and pinion steering is light, and not with no feel, while offering a turning circle of 9.8 metres. 

Clutch feel, too, is both well weighted and suitably assisted, the gear linkages also clatter-free through five forward ratios. Multiplication of cogs is matched well to APV?s naturally aspirated 1590cc four-cylinder (68kW/127Nm) G16A engine which, of course, is fairly torquey.

Fuel consumption is alleged to average 8.9L/100km. On test we achieved 10.5L/100km. 

APV is stopped by disc/drum brakes, rides on 14-inch steel wheels (with full-size matching spare) and it's suspended by rather firm strut (front) / leaf (rear) suspension. In spite of the skinny, tall stance, it?s worth noting the APV actually handles reasonably well, looking after understeer only once pushed. 

Despite its shortcomings, Suzuki APV does have its place in the burgeoning commercial van segment. At $18,990 (adding $475 if metallic paint is optioned) it?s a low cost - less expensive all its rivals -- reliable workhorse ideally suitable for the inner-urban grind. Though i cannot help feel given its loss of options and safety equipment, it might be even cheaper. 

An easy-to-drive package that manages much from the meagre mechanicals, APV can be as light on its feet as things are to the hip pocket.
