Bridal Makeup Tips - Finding Perfect Wedding Lipstick and Big, Beautiful Eyes

The first step: Proper Bridal Lipstick Application

Applying lipstick can be not even close to easy, especially when redder shades are involved, running the risk of "bleeding". To avert this, it is important to line the outer area of the puckers, then colour the lips completely with the liner color before properly applying any lipstick. This give a handy guideline, helping you keep the lipstick inside the proper boundaries. The liner-coloured layer underneath will also help your lips retain colour for much longer, even while the outer lipstick starts to fade away.

A strong red shade could be a great way to distract attention from eyes, that could be a particularly good idea if you have were built with a sleepless previous night the large day!

To make your lips seem more full, simply add a little gloss for their centre. It's as easy as that. You have lips that will look gorgeous all throughout your wedding reception!

It's well worth purchasing lighter colours: brighter, shimmering eyeshadow shades, plus some white eyeliner. This will get more light and attention, which makes them seem larger and more awake.

Although it might be tempting to choose a waterproof brand (especially if it's an outdoor wedding with uncertain weather). This could, however, do more harm than good. Waterproof eye make up won't stick to the inner eyelid, meaning the effect will diminish over the course of your day. (Just make sure you arm a bridesmaid with an umbrella to safeguard you against mother nature if necessary!)

Be sure to use an even lighter colour underneath your skills and on the inside third to create your vision even "larger".

For the opposite effect, black eye liner will make your vision appear darker and smaller. You may prefer this "smokey effect". Indeed, you might find going dark suits you better. Allow yourself plenty of time to experiment and ask for a variety of feedback within the weeks and months beforehand.

Miscellaneous Tips

    If you'd rather people notice your vision than your lips, wear a paler lipstick shade.
    If you've dark blue circles under your eyes, this is often covered up using a concealer. Consider using a yellow-based shade, or mauve if the skin is more pale brown.
    To build your eyes appear more open, line the inner eye with a creamy white pencil.
    To give your vision a seductive cat-like look, line them with black.
    If you're wearing black, it's hard to visit wrong with deep violet smokey eye tones.
    Metallic tones are great to add a little more colour. Just give a bit of gold, blue or bright lavender towards the inner corner of each eyelid.
    Smokey eyes needn't be dark. Bronzed, jewelled as well as green colours might have exactly the same (as well as) effect.
