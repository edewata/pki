The Brief Introduction of Electric Power



The electric power is a type of energy whose power is electric energy. It was invited within the 1870s. Its invention and application brought about the second high tide of industrialization. Simultaneously, the invention continues to be among the three technological revolutions in the world. There after, people's life continues to be changed by the science and technology. The large-scale electrical power system in the 20th century is one of the most significant achievements within the scientific history of a persons engineering. It's the power generation and consumption system that is comprised of sections for example power generation, power transmission, power transformation, power distribution and power utilization. This technique transforms the primary power source in the nature into the electrical power through the electric power unit. It supplies the electrical power to the users through transmission, transformation and distribution.

There are plenty of kinds of ways of electrical power generation. For instance, it may be generated through the thermal power, solar energy, wind power, nuclear energy, hydropower and so on. every way features its own demerit and isn't ideal. In the follow passage, they'll be introduced in detail. What comes first is thermal power generation. At present it's not a well known way, since it easily leads to the intense problems, such as smoke pollution, dust pollution and resource consumption. When it comes to hydro power, it is also not very ideal. It maybe submerges a lot of lands as well as can lead to the ecological damage. Besides, water power resource in the united states is restricted and often is influenced by the times of year. When the reservoir is affected with the breakdown, it's hard to image the result. The third way introduced within the article is wind power generation. It's a kind of noise and visual pollution. What's more, to be able to build the wind power station, a lot of lands and forests is going to be occupied, which has a bad impact on the vegetation cover. Meanwhile, the power generation is still not stable and uncontrollable. Fourthly, the electrical power can be generated by the nuclear energy. In the normal situation, the nuclear power is quite clear. But when the nuclear leakage happens, the result is very terrible. A lot of radioactive materials is going to be released, which is very harmful for that environment and people. Besides, the price of the nuclear energy station is extremely high. Therefore, how to choose the proper way for electrical power generation is a very important issue. It is strongly recommended for people to think about every aspect carefully.

Although now it is the internet era, the requirement for the electric power continues to be increasing, because we invite many electric products such as computer, household electrical appliances and so on. There's on doubt using the growth and development of the brand new technology, the electrical power has been the fundamental thing in our life.
