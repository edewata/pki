What Is Kratom

Kratom refers back to the plant Mitragyna speciosa Korth., a tree native to Thailand; it is mostly grown in the central and southern regions of the country, and just rarely in the north. The Mitragyna genus, part of the family Rubiaceae, can be found in tropical and sub-tropical regions of Asia and Africa. Asian Mitragynas are often found in rainforests, while the African species (that are sometimes still classed in a separate genus, Hallea) in many cases are present in swamps. Most species are arborescent, some reaching heights of almost 100 feet. The genus was handed its name by Korthals because the stigmas within the first species he examined resembled the form of a bishop's mitre. This genus is seen as a a globular flowering head, bearing up to 120 florets each. During the flower bud stage, the developing florets are surrounded and completely covered by numerous overlapping bracteoles. Mitragyna species are used medicinally and for their fine timber through the areas they grow.

Kratom is traditionally only used in Thailand, although some use in Malaysia has been reported. Besides kratom (or krathom), it also passes the names ithang, kakuam, and in southern regions, thom. Use dates far enough back that it is beginning can not be determined. And also being used like a narcotic drug in its own right, it's used as an alternative for opium when opium is unavailable, or to moderate opium addiction. In folk medicine, it's used to tread diarrhea. A little minority of users use kratom to extend sexual intercourse.

Users distinguish different types of kratom, two main kinds being distinguished by the color of veins in the leaf - red or green/white. The green-veined variety is supposed to possess a stronger effect. One study which surveyed Thai kratom users found that most users preferred a mixture of both, then red-veined alone and then white-veined alone. Growers in Australia report that both red and white veining occurs at different times in different plants which were all cloned in the same mother plant. They have not yet undertaken comparisons between the two.

Nearly all kratom me is by chewing fresh leaves. Different ways it is taken include grinding up and eating fresh, dried, or reconstituted dried leaves. Some villagers make use of the leaves in cooking. When preparing fresh leaf, the vein is extracted and sometimes salt is added to try to prevent constipation. Consumption of the leaf is usually followed by drinking something hot, for example tepid to warm water or coffee. Leaves can also be smoked, converted into a tea, or a crude resin extraction can be made. This resin extract is made by preparing a water extract from the leaves, boiling it down, after which shaping it into small balls which are rolled inside a material for example flour, then stored until use. This really is apparently a quite popular approach to consumption.

Users of kratom are usually peasants, laborers, and farmers who use the plant to overcome the burdens of their hard work and meager existences. Female users are apparently quite rare. Age of usage onset seems to be higher than for other drugs. Some research has found no addiction problems in villagers using kratom, while others apparently have. It seems likely that if utilized in doses sufficient for mu receptor crossover (discussed below), addiction is really a strong possibility. Heavy users may chew kratom between 3 and Ten times each day. While new users may only require a few leaves to get the desired effects, some users find as time passes they need to increase doses to 10-30 leaves or maybe more per day.

In certain areas, it had been said that parents would decide to give their daughters in marriage to men who used kratom instead of men that used marijuana. The idea is the fact that kratom users are hard working, while marijuana users are lazy. This belief is also maintained by many people from the users themselves, who report beginning use because of a need to work more proficiently, and who say while using drug gives them a strong need to will work.

The Thai government passed the Kratom Act 2486 which went into effect on August 3, 1943. This law makes planting the tree illegal as well as existing trees to become cut down. This law was not found effective, because the tree is native to the nation. Today, kratom is classed within the same enforcement group as cocaine and heroin by Thai law, and it has exactly the same penalties. One ounce of extract is punishable by death. Just like prohibition laws elsewhere in the world, it has succeeded only at increasing black market prices. An associated species, Mitragyna javanica, is often used as a substitute to obtain around the law, but it's not regarded as effective. The dominant alkaloid in this species is mitrajavine, that has not yet been pharmacologically tested.
