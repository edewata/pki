What's the Syllabus for GAMSAT



GAMSAT is open for college students of any major. It's a standardized exam held once in each and every year. There isn't any structured material for GAMSAT. It is the toughest exam. It requires your intellectual ability. ACER conducts this exam. It is the starting point of choosing the very best candidates for medicine.

Generally, the questions are tricky in GAMSAT. You need to have a sensible practice to answer the questions on time. GAMSAT has split into three sections. Each section handles different subject.

Also I've researched the subject areas and a starting point for a syllabus shows up below. The easiest way of preparation is depending on the previous year's question papers. Also we have certain subject ideas concerning the GAMSAT. We need to have knowledge concerning the below areas:

1. Humanities and Social Sciences

2. Written English communication (Basically the Essay ability as a copywriter)

3. Biology and Physical Science
a. 1st year university - Biology and Chemistry
b. Year 12 / HSC - Physics

It gives chance to all of the students to create the exam well. Even non science and ESL student can score well in GAMSAT.

Arts students can score more marks in Humanities and social science. Literature students can achieve good marks in English written communication. Science students can score high marks in Biology and physical science. It is a great advantage for all the students.

It's very hard to analyse the syllabus for Humanities and Social Studies. You might get any question from any chapter. Also for essay writing, good English written communication is significant.

Only section 3 topics are revealed. It is enough if you could complete everything associated with 1st Year University -biology and chemistry and year 12 HSC physics. I would suggest you to concentrate on biology and organic chemistry as you become more questions from all of these areas. There will not be many questions from physics.

All these questions test the reasoning ability and problem solving skills from the candidates.

These are all the popular materials for GAMSAT. You can make the best utilization of them. Also practicing with previous years question paper and Des O'Neil sample question paper shall help you more. Most of the questions in real GAMSAT are conversant to Des's sample question paper. Also questions get repeated each year.

1. Des O Neil's materials: Many students are using Des O Neil's materials. The guides and materials are great enough to prepare.

2. Ozimed Test: There's ozimed tests helps to test the ability of writing this exam. Ozimed is the test with all the questions much like GAMSAT. You can practice resolving problems. It will improve the ability of analyzing and reasoning.

3. Medired: It is important for that non science students. It gives basic understanding of the scientific concepts. It is expensive compared to other guides.
