= Overview =

PKI project uses [https://travis-ci.org/dogtagpki/pki Travis CI] for continuous integration service. When a patch is pushed to the [https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki main repository], the CI service will automatically generate a new build and run a set of basic tests. The process normally takes approximately 25 minutes to complete.

It is advised that each contributor sets up a personal Travis CI account to run the build and test before pushing a patch to the main PKI repository. To create a personal Travis CI account go to https://travis-ci.org.

'''Note:''' https://travis-ci.com is a paid-service for private projects while https://travis-ci.org is free for open source projects.
