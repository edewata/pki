Kratom is a unique herb, when used in low to moderate dosages it provides a stimulant; while higher doses act in a sedative manner. This really is most likely due to the active alkaloids which have both stimulant and sedative effects.

The stimulant level: At the stimulant level, the mind is much more alert and focused, there is increased physical energy, and often sexual energy is increased as well. The consumer is generally more talkative.

The sedative-euphoric-analgesic level: At higher dosages, people are convinced that they're less sensitive to pain with a calming sense of pleasure. Some research indicates the consumer may enter a dreamy state of bliss. Further, people can experience some itching or sweating. It is possible one might feel nauseated, but relaxation usually over-rides it. Appreciation of music can also be reported. Lots of people report a positive 'afterglow' the next day.

Kratom includes a long history of use as a pain-killer and treatment for people addicted to various opiates. Personally, i have friends who have been hooked on pain pills prescribed by their doctors. While Kratom doesn't give them the "high" they were used to, it did however help them get over the sickness of withdrawal when they were trying to quit the prescribed opiates.

Kratom use may cause nausea and constipation. Many people are hypersensitive towards the alkaloids Kratom, and may experience severe vomiting if using stronger doses.
