The cause why this happened to these  internet websites is on account of the fact that Panda take into consideration these sites as poorly optimize. Some of these websites were taken off the list because the content material of the site isn’t beneficial towards the user.

How To Steer clear of the Slap

Fortunately, the Panda slap can be avoided. It really is important that these sites must track the links connected to them. If there are low-quality links, then it is actually most effective to get rid of them. Thus, when Panda looks at the website, the website will have no negative association from those low-quality links. Instead of using poor links, it would be better if the web page focuses more on working with links from relevant and reputable websites. For example, instead of using the links from the Yellow pages, it would be better to use links from local online directories.

The next thing web sites must take into account is having a standard content that is essentially useful and informative. It would be best if the website has an attached blog that will continue to provide new, creative and valuable content to the website. When it comes to the content, it is important that the Google users will find it helpful and informative to them. If the business site has no weblog that is attached to their site or no new content material added from time to time, then Panda will think about this site irrelevant.

The huge mistake of some websites is that they fill there page with more advertisements rather of useful content material. In some instances, the content material the web-site use is just a duplicate one. If these are present in a website, then it is expected that they will receive a harsh Panda slap.
