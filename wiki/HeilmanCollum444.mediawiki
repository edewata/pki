Outreach, Information, and Identity: Why Church Signs Are essential



Though faiths differ on how so when they should evangelize to others, good, well-executed signs for churches serve plenty of purposes. Don't ignore the potential of the church sign to serve like a tool for outreach, a method to inform your congregation about upcoming events, and as the most visible symbol of the church's mission and identity. You're doing all of your community a disservice if you don't!

Here are a few things to consider when considering how to use your church sign:

Tools for Outreach

Your church sign is definitely an advertisement. As distasteful as that may sound, i am not saying it's equivalent to a company logo-- it simply means that it is a method of putting your best foot toward the overall population. You want people to take your church as seriously as you do: thinking about want your sign to mirror that?

Though an attractively-designed sign can, in and of itself, function as a compelling reason behind people to be curious about your church, your outreach efforts could be seriously bolstered with your sign as a message board. Inspirational quotes, scripture, and invitations to events like support group meetings or community fundraisers can serve to give people a concept of the mission of your church. LED signs can cycle through multiple messages at any given time, giving you a platform from which to transmit your church's message.

Information for Your Congregation

Beyond informing the general public about what your church is up to, a sign may also become a notice to your congregation about events.

Other communications vehicles, like email, social media, or newsletters, are only able to achieve this much to obtain your congregation involved; signs for churches can serve as that extra reminder they have to remember important times. In the information age, it's more essential than ever before to make sure your community knows about opportunities inside your church.

Symbolic of Your Identity

A sign is really a permanent fixture and therefore, is really a living symbol to both your congregation and also the public of what you are, what you would like to complete, and what you believe in. This is an chance to establish your identity - and also to communicate that identity to others.

There are many small methods church signs can reflect your church. Is the congregation traditionally-minded, or could they be more relaxed and open? What are its most important values? These are not trivial questions. They strike to the heart of methods you relate to the city around you.
