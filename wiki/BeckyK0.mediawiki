My name is Meredith Mendoza, I'm pretty new around this wiki, but I hope to be helpful as soon as I sort myself out. I've been out of work for just about a yeah and a half now, and I need to keep up my computer and editing skills, or I'll never get back to work. I'm looking forward to getting my brain moving again. Since I'm kinda new here, I would really be happy to get feedback on whatever I mess up. I guess you can add things on this page and I'll see them? I don't really know how that works, but I'll get it eventually.
