<font color=red>'''NOTE:''' Nightly builds have been converted into per-commit builds as of 01 Apr 2019</font>

As the product gets bigger and complex, building and maintaining the product gets difficult. So is the case with Dogtag. We have a per-commit based autobuilds enabled in COPR and a nightly infrastructure that runs IPA tests.

* [[Nightly builds#IPA_Nightly_test|IPA nightly test]]

= IPA Nightly test =

IPA uses components of Dogtag PKI to generate certificates, renew, etc. Cert related tests of IPA run every night.

2 versions of PKI are tested across 2 different platforms, creating 4 jobs in a Travis build:

{|
|-
! style="text-align:left;"|Versions
|10.6, master
|-
! style="text-align:left;"|Platform
|f28, f29
|-
|}

== Under the hood ==

# Travis enables the corresponding per-commit based COPR repo
# Installs IPA and pulls the corresponding Dogtag PKI packages from the COPR repo
# Runs cert related IPA tests

= Future Work =

# Move the complete nightly builds from Travis to Gitlab to sync up with the QE team
