My name's Lucas Irwin. I have been massively impressed with everyone's work on this wiki project, and I'm looking forward to . My day job is in accounting, but in my heart I'm just an internet addict. While my boss does a relatively good job of keeping me off the internet at work, I'm sure I'll be able to contribute.
