= Overview =
Travis CI uses 2 containers to build and run tests:
* [https://hub.docker.com/r/dogtagpki/pki-ci-containers/ pki-ci-container] - Used to build and test PKI core components.
* [https://hub.docker.com/r/dogtagpki/dogtag-freeipa-ci-containers/ dogtag-freeipa-ci-container] - Used in smoke testing PKI with IPA.

= Ways to build Container Images =
There are 2 ways to build a container image:
* [[Docker_Images#Manual Triggering  | Manual Triggering]]
* [[Docker_Images#Automated Triggering | Automated Triggering by push to official repo]]

== Manual Triggering ==
1. To trigger a manual build, go to the '''Build Settings''' from the repo you want to build as shown below:

[[File:1-docker-manual.png|700px]]

2. Click on '''Trigger''' button to trigger the build against that image

3. You can view the status under '''Build Details'''

[[File:2-Docker-manual.png|500px]]

== Automated Triggering ==
The build for existing images are auto-triggered when a change to '''Dockerfile''' is pushed to the linked github repo.

* For [https://hub.docker.com/r/dogtagpki/dogtag-freeipa-ci-containers/ dogtag-freeipa-ci-containers], the linked repo is located [https://github.com/dogtagpki/dogtag-freeipa-ci-containers here].
* For [https://hub.docker.com/r/dogtagpki/pki-ci-containers/ pki-ci-containers], the linked github repo is located [https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki-ci-containers here]

For building new image that doesn't exist:

1. Clone the corresponding repo.

2. Create a folder (for this example, we will call '''f27_test''').

3. Create a Dockerfile and write the required script.

4. Create a new entry under '''Build Settings''' in the corresponding repo in Dockerhub. For example:

[[File:Docker_automated_1.png|700px]]

Here:
* '''Type''' - Select the corresponding ''tag'' or ''branch'' against which automated trigger should be build.
* '''Name''' - Enter the corresponding ''tag's'' or ''branch's'' name 
* '''Docker File Location''' - Enter the location of the ''Dockerfile'' you created. In our cases, it's ''/f27_test''
* '''Docker Tag Name''' - Enter the tag name of the image. In our case, it will be ''dogtagpki/dogtag-freeipa-ci-containers:f27_test''

5. Click on '''Save Changes'''

6. Push the local repo to the github repo.

7. You can see the details under '''Build Details'''. Shown below:
