Website Translation

Although among the easiest ideas to try, but transmogrifying your website perfectly into a larger source of information can significantly help you grow your rank. Try and perk up your audience base by branching it out and translating your online pages into different languages.

ROR Sitemaps

 Bloggers should even consider an ROR sitemap for their website pages - since it will not only help their site get indexed by most widely used search engines like google, but will also leverage the overall readability factor.

Internal Linking

 Blog owners may integrate the process of internal linking as well. However, you should always remember that a very few websites actually implement this approach. Nonetheless, linking internally to other pages on the website has proven to be an effective SEO technique.

Target Phrases, Not Words

 You may even boost your blog ranking and overall response from your audience by zeroing in on keyword phrases. You may not realize but focusing on longer keyword phrases will even derive better results rather than general and popular words.

Use Tags

Last but not the least; you should reap the benefits of ‘tags’ as a way to control competition wherever possible. It's very important for bloggers to link other sites that are within their niche to their website for sharing purposes. At the same time, using tags should help fend off other sites from shooting up in terms of their ranking at your expense.
