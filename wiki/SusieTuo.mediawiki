Hello,  My name is Abdul Gentry. I have been seriously impressed with how much is up 
on this wiki, and I'm looking forward to pitching in! I've been out of work for nearly three years now, and I have to keep up my computer and editing skills or I won't ever be able to get back to work. Also, staying home all day is starting to drive me a little batty, so I'm looking forward to forcing my brain to work again.
