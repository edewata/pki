My name's Sheree Frye. I'm impressed with everyone's work on this site, and I'm looking forward to being able to contribute! I'm a full time parent of three, and even though I should be sneaking in naps when I can, I spend pretty much all of my time on the web. It can get pretty boring staying in the house all day. Since I'm kind of new here, I would be happy to get feedback on whatever I accidentally bungle. I don't really know how that works, but I'll get the hang of it eventually.
