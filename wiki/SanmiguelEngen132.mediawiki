Forex currency trading Strategy - Slow Down to visit Fast



I come from a car racing background in that sport there is a saying that goes, "sometimes you have to decelerate to visit fast." This saying definitely applies to FX trading as well.

In auto racing, like trading, most rookies believe that greater you press the pedal, the faster you'll go. This might be true when driving in a straight line, but racing, much like trading involves many turns. Think about a typical trading month in forex. The month starts with non-farm payroll (NFP) on the first Friday and through this week price often behaves in a certain way. During the second week of every month, after NFP, currencies will frequently change course and behave in an entirely different manner. Now look at a typical trading day. Is there this? Yes, there are times when there is more price movement, but this movement rarely moves inside a straight line. As rookie traders we often put logic aside and focus on speed in the end attempt to trade every move we see and each gut feeling that people have. A rookie trader, similar to the rookie race car driver, often forgets or does not appreciate that it is how you manage your car, and your account, in the curves that determines the way you finish the race.

I've written before about one way you are able to decelerate when trading currencies online, I refer to it as taking two weeks off. Take a break from trading and define the reason why you desire to be an investor, what your expectations are, and whether or not those expectations are realistic. Ask may well person for those who have reasonable goals and expectations inside your forex trading. You can easily forget the guy by having an interesting accent is trying to sell us something and we forget to inquire about ourselves if what we should are hearing about forex success is affordable. Forex marketers would like you to believe in going fast since the faster they get you thinking, the faster you will buy.

Another way to slow down in forex trading is to assess the timeframe you are choosing to trade. Sure, there is much more adrenaline and excitement trading a lower time frame, but fast timeframes require fast making decisions. Decelerate and trade a higher time frame which means you will have more time to judge the chart, choose where you wish to trade from, and make better decisions. I showed countless traders how easy it is, and low stress it can be, to check a chart two times a day rather than twice every minute.

The finish goal associated with a forex currency trading strategy is to grow your account. Account growth is the ultimate measure of success, not adrenaline. Take two weeks off and understand why you need to trade and then slow down and find out how fast your trading success will come. Your ability to handle those trading twists and turns can make all the difference.
