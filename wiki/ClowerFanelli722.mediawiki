Second, you'll be less stressed, and better able to deal with stress in your life. Contrary to what many smokers believe, smoking actually increases the quantity of stress you need to endure every day, and prevents you against effectively coping with stress.

The non-smoker, however, has only to deal with the regular stress of life...

Activities for example having fun with your children within the yard, visiting the beach or even the movies, and running together with your dog all become easier.
