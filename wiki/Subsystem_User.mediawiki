= Overview =

This page describes how the subsystem user is created and used.

= Creation =

The subsystem user is created in CertUtil.addUserCertificate() with the following user ID:

<pre>
<subsystem type>-<hostname>-<port>
</pre>

For example: CA-server.example.com-8443

The subsystem user will contain a subsystem certificate (subsystemCert cert-pki-tomcat).

= Usage =

The subsystem user UID is used in the following cases:
* requesting for subsystem certificate from a remote CA (see ConfigurationUtils.configCert())
* requesting for subsystem certificate from an SD CA (see ConfigurationUtils.configCert())
* registering user (see ConfigurationUtils.registerUser())
* updating security domain (see UpdateDomainXML.process())
