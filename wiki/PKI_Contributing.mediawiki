== Submitting Changes to PKI Source Code ==

Select one of the following methods:

=== Using the PKI Subversion (SVN) Repository ===

* Follow the [[PKI_Subversion_Instructions|instructions to checkout a read-only copy of the PKI source code using subversion]].
* Save a copy of each original file planned on being modified,
* Apply changes as desired to each file, and
* Send a unified diff of the changes between the original and modified files to the [http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/pki-devel pki-devel@redhat.com] mailing list:
'''IMPORTANT:'''  A unified diff has the following format:
 diff -U 8 &lt;original file&gt; &lt;modified file&gt;
By default, the unified diff format is the only format provided by Subversion ('''svn diff'''), so this method should be followed when using the PKI subversion repository.

See the [[PKI_Coding_Style|Coding Style]] guidelines for more information.

=== Using the PKI SRPMs ===

* Download the PKI SRPM(s):
*: To download the PKI source RPMS, the user must first install the yum utilities:
 yum install yum-utils
* Use <code>yumdownloader</code> to download ALL of the PKI SRPMS (where "{flavor}" equals "dogtag"):
 yumdownloader --source osutil pki-ca {flavor}-pki-ca-ui pki-common {flavor}-pki-common-ui\
   pki-console {flavor}-pki-console-ui pki-java-tools pki-kra {flavor}-pki-kra-ui\
   pki-manage pki-migrate pki-native-tools pki-ocsp {flavor}-pki-ocsp-ui\
   pki-ra {flavor}-pki-ra-ui pki-setup pki-silent pki-symkey pki-tks {flavor}-pki-tks-ui pki-tps {flavor}-pki-tps-ui pki-util
   
   '''<font color="RED">NOTE:  The 'pki-manage' RPM has been 'deprecated' on Fedora platforms in favor of 'yum' and 'yum-utils'!</font>'''
* Unpackage the SRPM(s):
 for rpm in *.rpm
 do
   rpm2cpio ${rpm} | cpio -idumv
   gtar -zxvf *.gz
   rm *.gz
 done
* Save a copy of each original file planned on being modified
* Apply changes as desired to each file
* Send a unified diff of the changes between the original and modified files to the [http://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/pki-devel pki-devel@redhat.com] mailing list:
'''IMPORTANT:'''  A unified diff has the following format:
 diff -U 8 <original file> <modified file>
