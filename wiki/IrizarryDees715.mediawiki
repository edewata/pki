Sleeping Aids

The most common prescription Sleeping aids approved to be used in treating insomnia are listed below: benzodiazepines (such as temazepam, estazolam,yet others); the newer, non-benzodiasepines (for example zolpidem (Ambien,Ambien CR), Zaleplon (Sonatal), and eszopiclone (Lunesta); and the melatonin receptor agonist ramelteon (Rozerem).

These three Sleeping aids work best when the individuals who are treated for insomnia are diagnosed by a physician and follow up treatment methods are regular. It's not uncommon by using these medications, some form of therapy may be required. For instance, Sonata has a 1 hour amount of action, therefore it can be used as middle-of-the night awakenings. Giving the relatively level "therapeutic playing field" one of the hypnotic sleeping aids, the price to the patient should be thought about when selecting a medicine. Of course, the list of approved medications within the patient's health plan much be considered.

The medications will often have a minimal incidence of negative effects, along with a low abuse potential. For instance, according to a published study in the American journal of Medicine in 1996 in which they analyzed various outcomes in 170 adult patients with long-standing sleep-disruptive disorders who have been given nightly benzodiazepine therapy (usually clonazepan) for at least six months, and often for several years. Of these patients, 146 (86 percent found that this therapy completely or substantially controlled their sleep issues, 8 percent had negative effects (for example morning sedation ) requiring Sleeping aids changes, 2 percent had relapses of alcohol or chemical abuse requiring hospitalization, and 1 percent at times misused their medications. Other less frequent side effects include morning, "hangover", dizziness, problems with balance, memory, or confusion.

Zolpidem, zaleplon, and eszopiclone are imidazopyridine medications that interact with a benzodiazepine receptor in the brain. Their advantages are rapid absorption, lack of active metabolites, and low risk for negative effects or abuse. Zolpidem has been extensively studied, by having an excellent therapeutic profile during nightly use for up to 6 months, although within our experience it may be used safely on the nightly bsis for more than a year in patients who are carefully followed. The typical dose is 5-10 mg. at night, with doses with doses of 15-20 mg at times getting used. Zaleplon is an ultra-short-acting agent that is good at promptly restoring sleep in patients having problems with nocturnal awakenings. The typical dose is 2 or 3 mg at bedtime.
