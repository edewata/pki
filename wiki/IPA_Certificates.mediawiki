= Overview =

This page describes the PKI certificates used by IPA.

= Certificate Profiles =

IPA uses the following certificate profiles:

* caCACert
* caOCSPCert
* caSignedLogCert
* caSubsystemCert
* caServerCert
* AdminCert
* caIPAServiceCert

= DS Certificates =

See [https://github.com/dogtagpki/freeipa/wiki/DS-Certificates DS Certificates].

= PKI Certificates =

= PKI Admin Certificate =
PKI admin certificate is stored in several locations:
* /root/ca-agent.p12 with nickname ipa-ca-agent (misleading nickname).
* /root/.dogtag/pki-tomcat/ca_admin.cert
* /root/.dogtag/pki-tomcat/ca_admin.cert.der
* /root/.dogtag/pki-tomcat/ca_admin_cert.p12 (moved to /root/ca-agent.p12)

= PKI Agent Certificate =
PKI agent certificate is stored in /etc/httpd/alias and tracked by IPA:
* ipaCert (CN=IPA RA)

For [https://github.com/dogtagpki/freeipa/wiki/Password-Vault IPA Password Vault] the certificate is exported and cached into /etc/httpd/alias/kra-agent.pem since python-requests does not support NSS. The cache is invalidated if the KRA authentication fails.

= IPA Certificates =

IPA certificates are stored in /etc/httpd/alias:
* <REALM> IPA CA (CN=Certificate Authority)
* <External CA DN>
* ipa-ca-agent (CN=ipa-ca-agent)
* ipaCert (CN=IPA RA)
* Signing-Cert (CN=Object Signing Cert)
