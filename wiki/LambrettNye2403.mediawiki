Graviola is a small, upright evergreen tree increasing 5 to 6 meters in elevation with big dark green and glossy leaves. It is indigenous to many of the warmest exotic areas in South and North The united state including the Amazon. It produces a sizable heart-shaped nutritious fruit that is 6-9", yellow green in color, with white flesh. The fruit is offered in regional markets in the tropics where it is called Guanabana or Brazilian Cherimoya and is excellent for making beverages and sherbets and, though just a little sour-acid, are able to be consumed out-of-hand.

All parts of the Graviola tree as listed on [http://graviolacancers.com/ www.graviolacancers.com] are utilized in alternative medicine in the tropics including the bark, leaves, roots, fruit and fruit-seeds. Different properties and utilizations are credited to the different parts of the tree. Normally the fruit and fruit juice is taken for worms and parasites, to cool temperatures, to increase mom's milk after childbirth (lactagogue), and as an astringent for looseness ofthe bowels and dysentery. The crushed seeds are utilized as a vermifuge and anthelmintic against internal and outside parasites and worms. The bark, leaves and roots are thought about sedative, antispasmodic, hypotensive and nervine and a tea is produced various ailments for those reasons.

Graviola has a long rich history of use in organic medication along with a long documented indigenous use. In the Peruvian Andes, a leaf tea is utilized for catarrh and the crushed seed is made use of to eradicate parasites In the Peruvian Amazon the bark roots and leaves are used for diabetes and as a sedative and antispasmodic. Indigenous tribes in Guyana use a leaf and/or bark tea of Graviola as a sedative and heart tonic. In the Brazilian Amazon, a leaf tea is used for liver problems and the oil of the leaves and unripe fruit is mixed by having olive oil and utilized externally for neuralgia, rheumatism and arthritis pain. In Jamaica, Haiti and the West Indies, the fruit and/or fruit juice is utilized for fevers, parasites, as a lactagogue, and diarrhea; and the bark or leaves are used as an antispasmodic, sedative, and nervine for heart conditions, coughs, grippe, hard childbirth, allergies, asthenia, hypertension and parasites.

Numerous bioactive compounds and phytochemicals have actually been identified in Graviola as experts have actually been studying its properties since the 1940's. Its numerous uses in natural medicine has actually been legitimized by this scientific research. The earliest studies were between 1941 and 1962. A number of studies by different researchers demonstrated that the bark along with the leaves had hypotensive, antispasmodic, vasodilator, easy muscle relaxant and cardiodepressant activities in animals. Researchers re-verified Graviola leaf's hypotensive properties in rats once more in 1991. Numerous studies over the years have shown that leaf, bark, root, stem and seed extracts of Graviola are antibacterial in vitro against many pathogens and that the bark has antifungal properties. Graviola seeds indicated active antiparasitic properties in a 1991 research, and a leaf extract showed to be active against malaria in two other researches in 1990 and 1993. The leaves, root, and seeds of Graviola demonstrated insecticidal properties by having the seed indicating solid insecticidal activity in an early 1940 research. In a new 1997 medical study, novel alkaloids were found in Graviola fruit with anti-depressive consequences in animals.

In an 1976 plant screening program by the National Cancer Institute, the leaves and stem of Graviola showed active cytotoxicity against cancer cells and specialists have been following up on this study ever before since. Much of the analysis on Graviola concentrates on a novel set of phytochemicals called annonaceous acetogenins. The potent antitumor, pesticidal and/or insect antifeedant properties of these annonaceous acetogenins have been reported and patented. Graviola produces these natural compounds in leaf, bark and twig tissues, and they have be documented to have both extremely anti-tumor and pesticidal properties.

Mode of activity researches in 3 different laboratories have actually recently determined that acetogenins are wonderful inhibitors of Complex I in mitochondrial electron transportation systems from numerous organisms featuring tumors. Study on various Annona varieties of plants has actually given lots of extremely potent acetogenins. Many of them have cytotoxicity by having ED50 values as reasonable as 10-9 ug/ml. Active compounds from Graviola and other Annona plants have been submitted to the NIH anti-AIDS screen by Purdue University and their work is proceeding with an amount of additional active plant types in the Annona plant family. Thus far, Purdue and/or it's staff have filed about 9 US and/or intercontinental patents on their work around the antitumorous and insecticidal properties and uses of these acetogenins.

Three different analysis groups have actually isolated novel compounds in the seeds and leaves of Graviola which have actually indicated substantial anti-tumorous, anticancerous and selective toxicity against various types of cancer cells, publishing 8 medical studies on their seekings. One research demonstrated that an acetogenin in Graviola was selectively cytotoxic to colon adenocarcinoma cells in which it was 10,000 times the effectiveness of adriamycin (a chemotherapy drug). Cancer analysis is continuous on Graviola, and four brand-new studies have actually been published in 1998 which further narrow down the certain phytochemicals which are demonstrating the greatest anticancerous and antiviral properties.

Another evaluation in the Skaggs Scientific Report 1997-1998 states, "Annonaceous acetogenins, particularly those by having next door bis-tetrahydrofuran (THF) rings, have exceptional cytotoxic, antitumor, antimalarial, immunosuppressive, pesticidal, and antifeedant tasks. Several of these fatty acid derivatives have similar carbon skeletons; their striking variety emerges primarily from the relative and absolute configuration of their several stereogenic oxygen functions."

Purdue University has actually operated a lot of study on annonaceaous acetogenins, much of which has been cashed by The National Cancer Institute and/or the National Institute of Health. In one of their assessments titled Current Advances in Annonaceous Acetogenins, they explain: "Annonaceous acetogenins are waxy substances including C32 or C34 long chain fatty acids which have been incorporated by having a 2-propanol unit at C-2 to form a lactone. They are just discovered in a number of genera of the plant family, Annonaceae. Their varied bioactivities as antitumor, immunosuppressive, pesticidal, antiprotozoal, antifeedant, anthelmintic, and antimicrobial representatives, have actually brought in many interest worldwide. Recently, we reported that the Annonaceous acetogenins can selectively hinder the growth of cancerous cells as well as inhibit the growth of adriamycin resistant tumor cells. As more acetogenins have actually been isolated and extra cytotoxicity assays have actually been operated, we have actually seen that, although most of acetogenins have high effectiveness among numerous solid human tumor cell lines, a few of the derivatives within the different structural types and some positional isomers showed remarkable selectivity's among certain cell lines, e.g., against prostate cancer (PC-3). We now understand the primary methods of activity for the acetogenins. They are potent obviations of NADH: ubiquinone oxidoreductase, which is in an important enzyme in complicated I leading to oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria. A the past few report showed that they act directly at the ubiquinone-catalytic site (s) within complex I and in microbial glucose dehydrogenase. They also hinder the ubiquinone-linked NADH oxidase that is peculiar to the plasma membranes of cancerous cells."

In 1997, Purdue College published details with appealing news that many of the annona acetogenins "not just are successful in killing tumors that have actually proven resistant to anti-cancer agents, but additionally appear to have a special affinity for such resistant cells." In a number of interviews after this info was advertised, Purdue pharmacologist Dr. Jerry McLaughlin, the lead specialist in many of Purdue's researches on the Annona chemicals, states cancer cells that survive chemotherapy may establish resistance to the broker originally used against them along with to other, even unconnected, medicines. "The term multi-drug resistance (MDR) has been put on this sensation," McLaughlin states. He describes that such resistance establishes in a small percentage of cancer cells when they develop a "P-glycoprotein mediated pump" capable of pushing anti-cancer brokers away from the cell prior to they can kill it. Regular cells seldom develop such a pump.

In the June problem of Cancer Letters, the Purdue analysts reported that the annona acetogenin, bullatacin, preferentially eradicated multi-drug resistant cancer cells because it shut out processing of adenosine triphosphate, ATP, the chief energy-carrying compound in the body. "A multi-drug resistant cell requires an incredible amount of energy to run the pump and extrude points away from the cell," McLaughlin points out. "By inhibiting ATP manufacturing, we're essentially pulling the plug on its energy source." However exactly what about the consequence on ATP in ordinary cells? "Ordinary cells and common cancer cells might be able to reduce the outcome of this compound due to the fact that they don't call for huge amounts of energy needed by the pump-running cells," the Purdue analyst states. "The resistant cell is using its extra power for this pump as well as to grow, so it is truly taxed for energy. When we mess by having the energy supply, it eradicates the cell." 

In the June issue of the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, McLaughlin and his coworkers explained a study of 14 Annona compounds that appear to be powerful ATP blockers. "This research tells us just how to increase this activity, so we have a quite great strategy what compounds we 'd want to attempt in animals by having multi-drug resistant tumors," he points out.

While the most recent research on Graviola has actually focused on its cancer-fighting consequence it is interesting to indicate that medication men in South United states have made use of it for centuries to treat an amazing number of conditions.
