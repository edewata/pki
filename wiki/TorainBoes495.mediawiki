So, it sounds just like a great idea, but exactly how would you figure out how to allow it to be all happen? No problem. Below you will find solutions to frequently asked questions regarding holiday rentals. Read on, my pal, your next "home from home" holiday rental is right nearby.

Faq's on holiday Rentals

Do you know the benefits of a vacation rental?

Do you ever wish your hotel room had somewhat more personality? Yeah, I figured so. Well, renting someone else's home for your vacation might just be the thing you're looking for. Usually offering larger areas than rooms in hotels, these vacation rentals are all about living like you were in your house. They provide greater privacy than hotel rooms and many rentals possess a cooking area to cook, which in the end will save you money if you prepare a number of your personal meals.

You'll relish several rooms, and maybe even different levels, rather than one big room in which the whole family sleeps. Many owners will leave info on things to do and find out in the local area. Holiday rental homes are clean, friendly, comfortable and inviting. This is because many of them aren't just rental homes, but also function as the owner's own residence for part of the year.

Most holiday rentals are usually cheaper on the per night basis than their hotel counterpart. By renting from the owner you'll avoid taxes, tips along with other extraneous charges. However, there is a wide variation among costs based on a number of factors (see How Much Must i Count on paying below)

Do you know the drawbacks of the holiday rental?

Of course, almost always there is the other side of the coin. As holiday rentals aren't usually monitored with a central managing company, you'll only know what you are setting yourself up for when you actually arrive to your rental. Many owners require pre-payment, or at least a sizable deposit fee, before arriving. Therefore, if things aren't the way you anticipated after arriving, or if you discover your dwelling unacceptable and choose to go to a local hotel, you might lose any money you prepaid. This is also true for last second cancellations. There isn't usually a refund. You usually run the risk of getting less than you would expect, but, it's rare.

Usually, vacation rentals are usually cheaper than a typical accommodation per night. But, not necessarily, so be certain that you're confident with the cost you will be inspired to pay.

Another disadvantage to holiday rentals is the lack of a managing member on site to deal with any problems that you might encounter with the home or on your stay in general. Most owners get around this by having a listing of emergency numbers, power companies along with other such items open to the renter whenever they need anything.

What amenities are part of a holiday rental?

Since every rental is owned by another owner, each will include different amenities. Some include pools, spas, others with golf packages, and horse stable privileges. In cities with tourist attractions, some owners include tickets to local attractions.

Most vacation rentals include the necessities: TV, equipped kitchen, towels, linen, and everyday appliances, however it never hurts to inquire about these questions when looking for the perfect place. Be sure to understand exactly what you're spending money on before sending in the payment.

What types of rentals are available?

Virtually any type of dwelling that you would want to live in on your vacation is available somewhere. From studios in downtown Manhattan to a villa within the south of Spain, you'll be able to learn what you are looking for. The plethora of available options is mind boggling. Additionally, every week, month and year you will find new possibilities as owners put their homes up for just certain weeks or months of the season, the options are constantly changing.

Are holiday rentals only available in the US?

Holiday rentals are available worldwide. They can be found in every state of the US and nearly every country on the planet. Don't be misled by their different names, though. Vacation rentals are also referred to as holiday cottages, tourist rentals and holiday rentals. Should you be looking for just one in Europe, the Italians call them agriturismi, while the French say gites. If you are in Germany you'll be searching for ferienwohnungen (yep, attempt to say that 3 times fast with a bratwurst in your mouth!)

It doesn't matter what you call it, though, a holiday rental is a superb option for those on the point of take a few weeks removed from reality and relish the good life a bit.

How do I find a property?

There are several methods to start finding the perfect vacation rental for your next trip. Seek advice from your local tour operator to find someone in your area that are experts in finding owners and renters and getting them together. Another option may be the yellow pages. Finally, there's a wealth of info on the Internet. Key in searching for "vacation rentals" and also over 13,300,000 websites can be found just on http://www.google.com alone.

Most of the holiday rental services on the web are only the "go-between" or the "classified" section of the newspaper. They take no responsibility for the truth or correctness from the ads which are listed on their sites. So, research your options by looking into making telephone calls, speaking with the owner and asking specific questions. Make sure you feel comfortable with the answers, if not, move on to the next rental, there are many.

If you're not comfortable with the whole renter/owner thing, there is another way to rent a holiday home. Some companies exist that strictly buy and rent out homes to vacationers. They offer a little more security so you feel you are truly getting what you bargained for (although nothing is ever 100% certified). Additionally, sometimes these agencies will give you cancellation insurance. Quite simply, if you cancel before arriving, they may be in a position to refund some of the deposit or payment instead of keeping it as being most householders do if a cancellation occurs. With a few agencies you will find that you pay a greater price than heading for an owner. This is the way the agencies make their profits. There will always be benefits and drawbacks to every scenario. Make sure you know which works well with you.

How much should I count on paying?

This is a tough question to answer. The number you pay will depend on what country or state you're visiting, number of days you are staying, and kind of house you're renting. Some owners offer package deals including tickets or sightseeing events along with the rental, others include bonus days if you stay for a certain length of time. There are other owners who may offer free or add-on home cleaning service with your stay although some visit great efforts to ensure you have everything you need, even additional items such as a crib, highchair or wheelchair. Each vacation rental will be entirely diverse from the following. Your best bet after deciding on your destination would be to review multiple rentals to determine which is much better suitable for your needs and overall budget.

Are there any hidden fees?

Hidden fees usually only emerge once you have arrived. These could include extra for telephone calls, home cleaning service, extra person fees, excess heat and air-conditioning bills, pet deposit, computer access... etc. Again, be extremely thorough when interviewing who owns your prospective holiday rental. Ask about any "extra" fees, or maybe a home is "all-inclusive". Have you got free use of all the pantry and foods? How about the laundry supplies? All utilities? It never hurts to ask!

Holiday rentals

In summary, cover all bases by asking plenty of questions. Having your agreement in writing is another very smart idea. After these basics are out of the way you will be ready to take off for your home-away-from-home holiday rental. Try one this season and see on your own that holiday rentals can be a fantastic means to really obtaining the full enjoyment from your next vacation.
