This article will provide tips for this common problem.

Make sure you watch your posture at all times, whether standing or sitting. Poor posture leads to back problems. You should sit up in your chair at all times, and arm rests are important on chairs if possible to allow your back the support it needs. Extended use of a chair without arm rests can really put a strain on the back.

Heat therapy is a good method to relieve back pain. Heat therapy (such as heating pads, hot bath, etc.) will not only relieve pain in the affected area, but also will provide some healing benefits. Applying heat directly to the affected area will provide instant relief, some people find alternating heat and ice therapy provides the maximum benefit.

Taking a warm bath can help to relieve back pain. Warmth loosens tight muscles and helps you to relax. Sitting in a bath has relaxing properties all its own. Enjoy the bath for as long as you are comfortable and keep the water warm, but not too hot, to avoid burning your sensitive skin.

Consider buying a recliner. A reclining chair can be very helpful for temporarily relieving back pain, while you are watching television or sleeping as they put your body in a zero gravity position. So next time your visit your local furniture store, be sure to take a look at the recliners that they have in stock.

Heat therapy is a good method to relieve back pain. Heat therapy (such as heating pads, hot bath, etc.) will not only relieve pain in the affected area, but also will provide some healing benefits.

Some back pain is tolerable and is not the sign of anything actually wrong with your body, so a great remedy to alleviate it is to simply take your mind off of it. Soak in a warm tub or listen to some music with mild back pain until it passes. Dwelling on it may make it worse.

Sleep in the proper position to prevent back pain and avoid aggravating existing back pain. If you sleep on your side, place a pillow between your knees. If you sleep on your back, try placing the pillow under your knees. A firm mattress will also help to alleviate pain.

If you have disk problems, avoid sitting for long periods of time. People suffering from disk problems should be careful not to sit in the same position for too long. When you have to sit, use a lumbar cushion or recline the seat backwards to alleviate stress on the spine. If you are going on a long car journey, use the previous tips, and don't forget to pull over regularly so you can take the pressure off your spine and stretch your legs.

It's always great to find some kind of lumbar support if you have back pain, so roll up a towel to put behind your back when you sit down. Having this type of support for your back will help to alleviate and maybe even help to eliminate lower back pain in most people.

Apply ice to your back when it is feeling sore. Using ice on your pain is a simple and effective way to get immediate relief for any back pain. Ice will quickly reduce swelling to the entire area, which will automatically reduce pain sensations. Avoid putting ice directly on skin.
