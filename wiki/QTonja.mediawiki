My name's Kennith Jennings. My profession is in the fascinating field of "paper pushing", but to be perfectly honest I'm just an internet nerd. While my boss does a decently good job keeping me offline at work, I'm positive I can contribute around here. Since I'm kind of new here, I would honestly appreciate feedback on whatever I accidentally mess up. I guess you can put stuff on this page and I'll see them?  I'll get it soon.
