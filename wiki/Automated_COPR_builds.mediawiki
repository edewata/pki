= Overview =

As the product gets bigger and complex, building and maintaining the product gets difficult. So is the case with Dogtag. Currently, we have per-commit automated builds that run on COPR for the following components:

* JSS
* tomcatjss
* ldapjdk
* pki

= Workflow =

# Developer pushes a commit directly (or by merging PR) to respective Github repo
# [Automatic] Github has a webhook setup to COPR. So, Github sends a notification to COPR
# [Automatic] COPR clones and the repo and runs the file located in `.copr/Makefile`
# COPR builds the package with NVR: <font color=red><pkg>-<version>.<timestamp>.<commit-ID></font>

Look below for packages and their corresponding COPR build location
