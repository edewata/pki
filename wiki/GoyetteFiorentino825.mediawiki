Give yourself rewards. If you're adhering to your diet, reward yourself every now and then with a little dessert of an aperitif. Don't think that doing this means you've failed to follow your diet. It just means you're rewarding yourself for sticking to your goals. However, rewards should be occasional, not frequent occurrences. Remember that your weight loss program is not intended as punishment. Instead, you should look at it as a lifestyle change. Visit [http://www.lidaa.org lida] to get more information.

Try to not look at the overall picture, but instead focus on your weekly goals. Instead, stay focused on the weight you want to lose each week.
