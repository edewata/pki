This page contains features we'd like to see in the project.  Can you help? Please check our [[PKI_Roadmap|Roadmap]] also.

== General Requests ==

=== Misc Features ===

* Better Active Directory integration 
** issuing certificates to servers running in Windows via Auto Enrollment Proxy
* Better integration between Fortitude (mod_nss) and CS
** automated certificate issuance and renewal
* OS integration
** automatic CA discovery
** centralized policy management
* Make subsystem smaller and faster
* Implement a new subsystem to management CRLs, CA certificates (Trust Management Server)
* Implement document signing subsystem
* Implement time stamping subsystem
* Provide user interface to the security domain where subsystem infomation is stored
* Implement service discovery for the CA service
* Provide backup and restore capability so that certificates and requests can be migrated easily
* Integrate log4j into the server

== Shared PKI Subsystem Enhancement Requests ==
=== Common Features ===

* Change the backend to use a sql server
* Change Java-based console to web-based
* Provide better UI-based management utility
* Integrate velocity (template system) into the subsystem
* Better exception and error handling throughout the server
* Create symmetric key calls in the JSS library and integrate this new API in pki-symkey
* Remove the osutil library
* Improve the startup and shutdown time of the Java servers

=== Util Features ===

* Remove the dependencies on netscape.security.*
** Change the server to use JSS's ASN.1 decoding/encoding
* Remove the dependencies on sun.io.*

== Individual Server-Side PKI Subsystem Enhancement Requests ==
=== Certificate Authority Features ===

* Improve the way how we handle large CRLs
* Implement CMP protocol
* Make it smaller and more self-contained so that it can be embedded into other applications
* Support kerberos authentication plugin for enrollment
* Improve HSM and CA integration, make installing and debugging HSM easier
* [http://www.freeipa.org IPA] Integration
* [http://directory.fedoraproject.org/wiki/Mod_nss mod_nss] Integration
* Update the user interface with Web 2.0 style
* Intergrate JAAS Authentication framework into the server
* Support multiple signing keys within the same instance
* Support EV certificate profile

=== Data Recovery Manager Features ===

* Need cleaner interface between CA and DRM. Potentially use XML-based protocol.

=== Online Certificate Status Protocol Manager Features ===

* Improve performance
* Support SCVP
* Intergrate path validation service

=== Registration Authority Features ===

* Support SCEP encoding/decoding natively in RA. 
** RA currently does not have any ASN.1 facility, and it relies on CA to encode the SCEP and return authentication information back.
* Support SQL engine other than SQLite
* Support multiple-level agent approvals
* Support more authentication types (SQL, flatfile, ...etc)

=== Token Key Service Features ===

* Provide management UI to manage master keys

=== Token Processing System Features ===

* Build a small TPS that has CA/TKS/TPS functionalities all in one
* Implement TPS in Java
* Support TPS cloning
* Consolidate the token management UI and the security officer UI
* Clean up the protocol between TPS and ESC

== PKI Subsystem Tools Enhancement Requests ==
=== Java Tools ===

* Improve startup time
* Consider to provide user interfaces to some of the tools

=== Native Tools ===

* Create man pages for the native tools
* Provide a set of command line utilities, that can be bundled in the base OS, that will enroll, renew certificate in Apache web servers, Machines

== Individual Client-Side PKI Subsystem Enhancement Requests ==
=== Enterprise Security Features ===

* Need ways to enroll a token without the backend (TPS, CA, TKS...etc)
* Build end-user applications around ESC
** Sign files, encrypt files
** ssh to web sites
