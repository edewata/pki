Twitter Marketing - Use TweetAdder to Automate Your Twitter Business

OK...I'm addicted on twitter. I likely did what a lot of you have carried out: I signed up with twitter some months back...looked at it...and said.."Now what am I supposed to do with it?" And walked away.

But, i quickly sat in on the webinar, talking about social media. About having 100,000 followers on twitter, and how twitter is used to 'introduce' your company, send helpful tips, after which move followers to wherever you want them to go.

So, I went back to twitter, got TweetAdder, and also the proverbial lightbulb discontinued. After 7 days, Now i have 1700 followers, and have set up another account, especially for local 'Tweeters'

TweetAdder automates just about everything you would want to do with twitter. As I am penning this article, TweetAdder has added 100 followers to my account, and it is automatically sending my tweets which i set up yesterday.

There is a growing number of twitter programs that will do everything you can actually want on twiiter: But TweetAdder may be the just one which i have discovered which will do all of that...automatically.

For example, you will find programs to locate people that you should follow. But they will only LIST those individuals; you need to undergo and 'follow' them yourself. TweetAdder allows you to search for individuals to follow by tweets, their bio, location (zipcode, city,state), or even following the followers of specific members. You choose how many you need to follow, click the mouse, and TweetAdder not just finds the folks, but it automatically SIGNS YOU UP as a follower. You are able to place it and walk away.

Technology-not only to automate your tweets. Ready your messages all at once, make about 20 of these. Load them in to the 'Tweet" submitter, and minimize the program. Now, automatically, every 40-60 minutes, depending on the setting that you simply set, your 'tweets' venture out.

TweetAdder keeps track of your 'Follows', as well as your 'Followers. Your 'Unfollows' are also automated. Choose how many you need to unfollow, and TweetAdder takes care of it. Direct Messages may also be sent...to whatever class of followers you want....'New followers first', 'Random followers', etc.

You are able to set everything up at the same time; getting new follows, following new follows, unfollowing, DMs, Tweets, and going towards the 'Automation' page, and click...TweetAdder runs in the background.

There are various programs that will do all of these services, and most seem to be free. TweetAdder is $55 for just one account; up to five accounts can be treated for an additional $19. Why can you want extra accounts? I've got a general account, which is centered on businesses and internet marketing; I've just started another account, which is dedicated to local tweeters, based on zipcode. The affiliate marketing program is excellent; 50%. Sell 2, as well as your program is free.
