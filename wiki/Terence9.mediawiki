What's up?  My name's Samuel Petty and I'm pretty new here, but I aspire to be a useful contributor very soon. I've been unemployed for nearly a year, and I need to keep up my computer and editing skills, or I will never be able to get back to work. I'm looking forward to getting my brain moving again.
