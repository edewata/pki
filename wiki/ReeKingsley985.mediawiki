Five Steps To Wealth Through Real estate investment



Although youbecome quite wealthy by purchasing property (whether or not the value of the property never rises)... you should be in a position to.

The five step formula to wealth through real estate investing is:

1) Purchase income producing real estate at below market price prices

2) Buy (leverage) and hold additional properties with time

3) Have your property professionally managed

4) Properly direct the money flow from your investment properties

5) Become financially secure and wealthy with time

It's that easy because...
Purchasing real estate supplies a vehicle and opportunity which really doesn't have peers. It's in the own category. Real estate provides leveraging opportunities, financing and tax benefits that other investments (stocks, bonds, CD's, etc.), legally, aren't permitted to offer.

And purchasing property offers another thing the others don't typically provide: a predictable income that commences immediately following a property purchase.

This type of investing has been in existence for many years. When executed properly, it's reliable, predictable and lucrative. It may appear complex initially but is really quite a simple and straightforward process once familiar. Following the correct resources are in place and purchases completed, there are very few "moving parts." It functions similar to it's with an auto pilot with good property management.

A particular perspective and understanding is unquestionably necessary. Just how much property an individual owns isn't primary aim or focus. What's most important is how much cash flow the properties generate that is based on factors for example: purchase price, renovation expenses, fees, rents, property management costs, mortgage reduce rate, etc. Naturally, you need to understand the variables to be knowledgeable encourages effectiveness which could then be replicated over and over. It might be a method, which in many ways, functions like franchising junk food restaurants.

NOTE: There are a few other necessary ingredients associated with this investment model: 1) to have a genuine need to become wealthy which helps to develop your 2) vision and investment goals, 3) a level of patience and 4) discipline which enables your 5) long-term plan for success by managing your cash flow properly...
Here is a very general illustration of a long term goal and just how it really works:

Determine that you had been in a position to get one rental property each year for fifteen years (think leveraging). In case your fifteen properties were producing typically $700 per month each in rental income, after the fifteenth year, you'd be receiving a collective cash flow of $10,500 monthly. Now that you've been doing this for a short while and had been disciplined, that cash could now be directed towards your personal living expenses (retirement perhaps) or for reinvesting purposes.

Keep in mind, that if you purchased the homes with fifteen year mortgages (which we suggest), the homes bought in the earlier years are starting to become paid off. So not just are you finding the average $700 monthly from each property, you're also becoming who owns a growing number of homes that no more have mortgages should you obtained financing. They're beginning to become yours outright.

Plus, yet, another possible benefit: there is a quite strong likelihood that the properties have also appreciated in value through the years.

So now you, the focused, patient, disciplined property investor, have received:

- Built-in equity immediately due to an under market price purchase

- Positive monthly income throughout

- Mortgage principle reduce through the years

- Outright property ownership once mortgages paid

- Highly likely property value appreciation with time

Certainly, this is not enough information to equip you to immediately begin investing in property. The intention would be to share highlights of the income producing investment model for you and generate some understanding of its possibilities.
