* Look for the Authority Info Access extension in the certificate, and note the Location URIName value.
* Update the enrollment profiles to enable the Authority Information Access extension, and set the Location parameter to the Certificate Manager's URI.
* Restart the CA instance.

=== Submitting OCSP Requests Using the GET Method ===

* Generate an OCSP request for the certificate that's status is being queried.
* Paste the URL in the address bar of a web browser to return the status information.
