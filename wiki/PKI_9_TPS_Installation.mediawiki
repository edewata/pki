= Installation =

To install a TPS subsystem instance, become the '''root''' user, and execute the following commands:

 $ pkicreate -pki_instance_root=/var/lib       \
             -pki_instance_name=pki-tps        \
             -subsystem_type=tps               \
             -secure_port=7889                 \
             -non_clientauth_secure_port=7890  \
             -unsecure_port=7888               \
             -user=pkiuser                     \
             -group=pkiuser                    \
             -redirect conf=/etc/pki-tps       \
             -redirect logs=/var/log/pki-tps   \
             -verbose

= Configuration =

Configuration of this PKI subsystem can be accomplished in one of three ways:

'''(1)''' The configuration URL is present on the screen.  When this occurs, something similar to the following should appear on the screen (e. g. - Dogtag 1.3):

    PKI instance creation Utility ...
    
    
    PKI instance creation completed ...
    
    Starting pki-tps:                                        [  OK  ]
    
    PKI service(s) are available at https://&lt;fully qualified domain name&gt;:&lt;secure tps port&gt;
    
    Server can be operated with /etc/init.d/pki-tps start | stop | restart
    
    Please start the configuration by accessing:
    http://&lt;fully qualified domain name&gt;:&lt;tps port&gt;/tps/admin/console/config/login?pin=X4PRHsoagBcuNUGeneUM

<table>
<tr>
<td>'''NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;'''</td>
<td>Default secure tps port:&nbsp;&nbsp;</td>
<td>7889</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>Default tps port:</td>
<td>7888</td>
</tr>
</table>

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">'''NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;'''</td>
<td valign="top">Dogtag 9.0 uses a master daemon, 'pki-tpsd', with an optional specific instance<br>(e. g. - '/sbin/service pki-tpsd start | stop | restart [TPS instance])!</td>
</tr>
</table>

Invoke a browser, insert the configuration URL, and follow the step-by-step instructions displayed in each panel.

    '''IMPORTANT:&nbsp;&nbsp;''' When finished, don't forget to restart this PKI instance before attempting to use it!

'''(2)''' If the user no longer has access to the configuration URL displayed on the screen, one can find the configuration URL at the end of the '''/var/log/&lt;instance name&gt;-install.log'''.  For example:

    .
    .
    .
    [2008-02-22 18:27:58] [log] Configuration Wizard listening on
    http://&lt;fully qualified domain name&gt;:&lt;tps port&gt;/tps/admin/console/config/login?pin=X4PRHsoagBcuNUGeneUM

<table>
<tr>
<td>'''NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;'''</td>
<td>The pin is also stored in the '''/etc/&lt;instance name&gt;/CS.cfg''' file as the '''preop.pin''' parameter.</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
<td>The tps port is also stored in the '''/etc/&lt;instance name&gt;/server.xml''' file as the first uncommented "non-SSL HTTP/1.1 Connector" '''Connector port''' parameter.</td>
</tr>
</table>

Invoke a browser, insert the configuration URL, and follow the step-by-step instructions displayed in each panel.

    '''IMPORTANT:&nbsp;&nbsp;''' When finished, don't forget to restart this PKI instance before attempting to use it!

'''(3)''' PKI subsystems can also be configured "automatically" by creating and using the pkisilent component with a predefined profile.

    '''IMPORTANT:&nbsp;&nbsp;''' When finished, don't forget to restart this PKI instance before attempting to use it!
