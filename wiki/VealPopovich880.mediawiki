Weather prediction is at present a very crucial portion of our day to day lives as it helps us strategy out the activities for the coming week. Without weather prediction, we would be left helpless and in complete chaos. Weather forecasting has helped us to travel safer without becoming caught in poor weather conditions like rain, snow, hail and fog.

Jet streams are the name given to the patterns created by the wind that has blown high up in the Earth's atmosphere. High and low atmospheric pressure usually influenced by these jet streams. And a complex apparatus is vital to forecast the weather in this approaches. Apparatus incorporate satellites, computers, and barometers etc. But this was not the case in past. When technologies was not created, people had reply on observations. They noticed the atmospheric conditions to forecast the weather. One can even so forecast weather to a couple of extent with little observant attitude.
