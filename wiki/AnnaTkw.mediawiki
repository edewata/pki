My name is Zachary Mejia. I've been out of work for just about a yeah and a half, and I have to practice my computer and editing skills or I won't ever be able to get back into the workforce. Also, staying home all day is starting to drive me a little batty, so I'm looking forward to forcing my brain to work again. Since I'm still new here, I'd really appreciate feedback on anything I might bungle.  I'm sure I'll get the hang of it once I've had a little time to mess around.
