= Overview =
This is an effort to provide support for version specific docs and maintain a cleaner wiki

= Current scenario of our wiki =

* We have version specific docs in '''''dogtagpki.org''''' wiki with the prefix attached to title <PKI 10.x>. 
* Some of these wiki pages are extremely difficult to maintain and become outdated easily.
* Static pages (eg: instructions to submit patches) become outdated very easily
* No way to view all the pages that exist in our wiki
::- Some of the current wiki pages are outdated and useless

= Proposed scenario =

* Move version specific docs to '''''docs/''''' in the GitHub repo under the corresponding version branch (Eg: 10.6 docs to master and 10.5 docs to DOGTAG_10_5_BRANCH)
::- This provisions an option to create GH pages
* '''General knowledge docs''' (eg. Git, Travis, openssl, nss, etc) which are not specific to a PKI version can be moved to Github wiki or stay in mediawiki
* '''Product docs''' need to be versioned and added to the upstream repo's corresponding branch (as explained in #1)
* The wiki and docs will be written in Markdown (.md) file, allowing us to keep a uniformity across all docs

= Steps to implement =

Following are steps to implemented (in prioritized order):

# Write new ''product docs'' in upstream repo
# Move old ''product docs'' into upstream repo
# Move ''Knowledge Base'' docs into GH wiki

= Advantages of proposed scenario =

# Easier to maintain docs
# Uniformity of docs (in .md) provides an option for docs team to convert them into the desired format using tools (if exist)
# Option to view all docs and prune unwanted pages
