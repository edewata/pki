A Waterproof Basement - An Opportunity Waiting to Happen

Has a warm and dry basement too much to inquire about? Inside a dry basement, there isn't any musky odor, no mold or mildew either. There is nothing rusting or damp to touch. A waterproof basement is a wonderful thing.

A basement is usually a place that's dark and unfriendly. What if you could make it into a more enjoyable place to be? Would you do it? Of course you'd because it's room to complete whatever with. Oh the rooms you may create in a basement; let me factual that, usable and livable rooms in the basement. By doing several rather easy steps that just about any homeowner could do themselves, a dark and dreary basement can become a light and lively one.

The very first thing you need to do to get a waterproof basement is, which won't take long, to check the interior perimeter of the foundation walls and also the floor. You need to look for any cracks, chips or any other voids within the concrete. Should you come across some, simply fill in the gaps having a waterproof or epoxy product designed for concrete. Breaks within the concrete permit the water to move just a little faster towards the inside of your basement and that is not what you want.

In the event that went well, the next matter you should do is to pick up a few gallons of waterproof paint out of your local home improvement store. Don't forget to obtain the necessary tools there too if you don't already have them. Yet another thing, while at the shop, read the cans label. A few of the waterproof paints/sealants come with an extremely strong odor so if you require a mask you can get among those too.

A waterproofing paint is applied just like regular paint. Coat every nook and cranny to make a solid barrier with the product. As the product dries, it is area of the foundation wall and form a "seal" which won't let in any water. It may take a couple of days to dry and cure. It is important that sufficient time is allowed. Otherwise, you can ruin the effectiveness of the barrier as well as your time and money continues to be wasted. You have carried out a great job and have just completed one method to get yourself a waterproof basement.

If you want to take it a step further with the waterproofing paint, paint the basement floor for any more secure waterproof basement. The basement floor is also produced from concrete and for that reason is prone to water reaching and coming upwards in to the flooring you may have. You wouldn't want moldy flooring would you? I didn't think so. If you do paint the ground, follow the same process as you did for the walls. When you initially start, start the farther away from the stairs and then come towards the stairs so that you don't paint yourself into a corner.
