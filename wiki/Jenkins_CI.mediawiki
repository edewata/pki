PKI uses Jenkins CI to run the tests on all patches submitted via [[Gerrit]].

See [[Jenkins CI Design]] and [[Verification bot]].

= Troubleshooting =

If Jenkins CI failed, follow this procedure to troubleshoot the problem:

* Open Jenkins job that failed, e.g. http://pki-jenkins-fedora.usersys.redhat.com:8080/job/Gerrit-Travis-Integration-Job/7/
* Click Console Output.

If one of the Travis jobs failed:

'''To check the logs:'''
* Click on the transfer.sh URLs posted in the comment
* The last part of the URL provides the log name e.g. https://transfer.sh/vsHte/pkitravis_compose_pki_core_packages.txt -> provides results of compose_pki_core_packages

'''To check the build console output:'''
* Open the Travis Job URL posted e.g. https://travis-ci.org/dogtagpki/pki-verification-ci/jobs/365697976
* Inspect the console output
* See [[Travis CI#Troubleshooting|Travis CI Troubleshooting]] to determine the cause of the problem.

If there is a problem with the patch, submit a new patch in [[Gerrit]] and CI will rerun automatically.

If there is a problem with the network or with Jenkins itself, add a "recheck" comment in Gerrit to rerun CI.
