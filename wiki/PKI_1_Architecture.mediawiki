= Server Architecture =

== Java-based Servers ==

For the Java-based servers such as CA, TKS, DRM, and OCSP. We use tomcat as the web engine.

The following diagram shows:

* tomcat process secure http request using jss via tomcatjss
* tomcat passes the requests to the PKI servlets that are part of cms.jar
* PKI servlets submits the request into the CMS engine for processing

The server uses JSS to perform cryptographic operations such as signing and encryption.

== Non Java-based Servers ==

* TPS and RA are using Apache as the web engine. mod_nss (aka fortitude) handles the SSL communication, with the help of the NSS library, in Apache.
* Apache passes the clear HTTP request to mod_tps for processing.

The server uses NSS to perform cryptographic operations such as signing and encryption.
