Twitter For Traffic - What Can Tweet Adder Do For You



Tweet Adder offers the user an array of options that are each designed to help boost their business. The main function of Tweet Adder is straightforward: Generate more followers for the Twitter account. The greater people you follow, the greater followers you will get in return. Many people on Twitter automatically follow those who've chosen to follow them, and others will want to look at your "bio" page before doing so. Therefore it's important to remember to keep the bio interesting and relevant - this is an opportunity for a minumum of one click-through for your site as people attempt to figure out who you are and why they should follow you.

Trying to find Followers Inside your Niche
Twitter enables you to look for your followers with very specific sets of criteria. Are you a business that only serves walk-in customers? You most likely only want folks your neighborhood. Are you a business that are experts in pink elephant sculptures? You'll likely not want to promote to individuals who can't stand elephants. Tweet Adder lets you find folks your neighborhood, search their tweets for specific keywords, search their bio page for specific keywords, and automatically follow them and their followers.

Keeping Your Followers
Running out of follows? If you realize half of the folks you follow don't follow back, you are able to set Tweet Adder to unfollow them inside a certain period of time to ensure whenever you hit your follow allowance you will find the identical amount of followers as you do followed.
