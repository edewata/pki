The Criminal Defense Lawyer

The criminal lawyer representing the defendant may be the criminal defense lawyer. He represents the defendant during the trial, working toward either a "not guilty" verdict, or perhaps a lenient sentence.

You need to realize that the role of the defense attorney isn't to merely push a "not guilty" verdict to the jury. When the accused is guilty or will most likely be found guilty, the defense lawyer will work to find the most lenient and beneficial resolution possible.

A criminal lawyer includes a couple options to ensure a minimized sentence for his client before the trial even begins.

The first is a plea bargain. With respect to the harshness of his client's crime, the probability of a guilty verdict from the jury, the available evidence, and the penalty's severity, a lawyer might be able to resolve the situation without going to court. The defendant would need to be willing to plead guilty and then his lawyer would work with the prosecutor to enforce a fee, reduced prison sentence or community service requirements.

Pre-trial motions allow the defense lawyer to get certain evidence discounted before and through the trial. His ultimate goal is to completely dismiss the situation.

Once the jury convicts the defendant, his criminal lawyer can evaluate the possible success of an appeal, particularly if new evidence has surfaced or a new witness is found. Sometimes evidence used throughout the trial could be proved false or even the sentence may prove to be too strict.

The Prosecution's Lawyer

The prosecutor is the one bringing the accusation from the defendant. Whether it's another individual or even the government, the prosecution's lawyer will represent the accuser, going after a "guilty" verdict and maximum punishment for that defendant.
