Faq's on Vacation Rentals

What are the advantages of a vacation rental?

Do you ever wish your hotel room had just a little more personality? Yeah, I thought so. Well, renting another person's home for the vacation might just be the thing you're looking for. Usually offering larger living spaces than hotel rooms, these vacation rentals are all about living like you were in your house. They offer greater privacy than rooms in hotels and many rentals have a kitchen area for cooking, which in the end could save you money if you prepare a number of your own meals.

You'll enjoy several rooms, and perhaps even different levels, instead of one big room in which the whole family sleeps. Many owners will leave information on things you can do and find out in the local area. Vacation rental homes are clean, friendly, comfortable and alluring. This is because many of them aren't just rental homes, but also function as owner's own residence for area of the year.

A majority of holiday rentals tend to be cheaper on a per night basis than their hotel counterpart. By renting directly from the owner you'll avoid taxes, tips along with other extraneous charges. However, there's a wide variation among costs with different quantity of factors (see How Much Must i Count on paying below)

Do you know the drawbacks of a holiday rental?

Of course, there's always the other side of the coin. As vacation rentals aren't usually monitored by a central managing company, you'll can just learn what you're setting yourself up for when you actually arrive for your rental. Many owners require pre-payment, or at best a sizable deposit fee, before arriving. Therefore, if things aren't how you anticipated after arriving, or if you find your dwelling unacceptable and choose to head to a local hotel, you might lose anything you prepaid. This is especially true for last minute cancellations. There isn't usually a refund. You usually run the risk of getting under you expected, but, it's rare.

Usually, vacation rentals tend to be cheaper than a typical hotel room per night. But, not necessarily, so make sure you are comfortable with the price you'll be asked to pay.

Another disadvantage to vacation rentals may be the insufficient a managing member on-site to deal with any issues that you might encounter using the home or on your stay in general. Most householders circumvent this having a listing of emergency numbers, power companies along with other such items available to the renter should they need anything.

What amenities are included in a vacation rental?

Since every rental is of a different owner, each includes different amenities. Some include swimming pools, spas, others with golf packages, and horse stable privileges. In cities with attractions, some owners include tickets to local attractions.

Most vacation rentals include the necessities: TV, equipped kitchen, towels, linen, and everyday appliances, but it never hurts to ask these questions when searching for an ideal place. Be sure to understand precisely what you are paying for before submitting the payment.

What types of rentals can be found?

Virtually any type of dwelling that you would want to reside in during your vacation is available somewhere. From studios in downtown Manhattan to a villa within the south of Spain, you'll be able to find what you are looking for. The range of available options is mind boggling. Additionally, every week, month and year there are new possibilities as owners put their homes up for only certain weeks or months of the year, the choices are never stand still.

Are vacation rentals only available in america?

Vacation rentals can be found worldwide. They can be present in every state of the US and nearly every country on the planet. Don't be fooled by their different names, though. Vacation rentals are also known as holiday cottages, tourist rentals and accommodations. If you are looking for just one in Europe, the Italians give them a call agriturismi, while the French say gites. If you're in Germany you will be looking for ferienwohnungen (yep, attempt to state that three times fast having a bratwurst in your mouth!)

Regardless of what you call it, though, a holiday rental is a superb choice for those getting ready to have a couple weeks off from reality and relish the good life a bit.

The majority of the vacation rental services on the internet are just the "go-between" or the "classified" section of the newspaper. They take no responsibility for the truth or correctness from the ads that are listed on their sites. So, research your options by looking into making phone calls, talking to the owner and asking specific questions. Make sure you understand the answers, otherwise, proceed to the following rental, there are plenty.

If you're not confident with the whole renter/owner thing, there's a different way to rent a vacation home. Some companies exist that strictly buy and book homes to vacationers. They offer a little more security so you feel you're truly getting that which you bargained for (although nothing is ever 100% fool proof). Additionally, sometimes these agencies provides you with cancellation insurance. In other words, should you cancel before arriving, they may be in a position to refund some of the deposit or payment instead of keeping it as being most householders do if a cancellation occurs. With a few agencies you will find that you have to pay a greater price than going directly to an owner. This is the way the agencies make their profits. There will always be pros and cons to each scenario. Make sure you know which works best for you.

How much should I count on paying?

This is a tough question to reply to. The amount you pay will depend on what country or state you're visiting, number of days you are staying, and type of house you are renting. Some owners offer package deals including tickets or sightseeing events combined with the rental, others include bonus days should you stay for a certain length of time. There are more owners who may offer free or add-on home cleaning service together with your stay while some go to great efforts to ensure you have everything you need, even additional items such as a crib, highchair or wheelchair. Each holiday rental is going to be entirely different than the next. The best choice after deciding on your destination would be to review multiple rentals to determine which is much better suitable for your needs and overall budget.

What are the hidden fees?

Hidden fees usually only emerge after you have arrived. These could include extra for phone calls, home cleaning service, extra person fees, excess heat and air-conditioning bills, pet deposit, computer access... etc. Again, be extremely thorough when interviewing the owner of your prospective vacation rental. Inquire about any "extra" fees, or maybe a home is "all-inclusive". Do you have free use of all the pantry and food items? How about the laundry supplies? All utilities? It never hurts to ask!

Vacation Rentals

After these basics are out of the way you will be ready to remove for your home-away-from-home holiday rental.
