Please read the [[PKI_Release_Notes|Release Notes]] to find out what's new and for late breaking information.  Additionally, see the [https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/wiki/FAQ#open-source FAQ section on Open Source] for more information.

Remember, Dogtag requires access to a 389 Directory Server for storage purposes, so one must be
available either through remote access on the network, or co-located locally on the same
machine that hosts Dogtag.

The 'yum' utility is used to install on platforms that use yum for package installation and management.

<ul>
If a 'local' directory server is to be utilized on Fedora (see http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/download.html for details):
* yum &#91;--enablerepo=updates-testing&#93; install 389-ds<br><br>
To obtain ALL Dogtag PKI packages for Fedora:
* yum &#91;--enablerepo=updates-testing&#93; install dogtag-pki<br><br>
To obtain INDIVIDUAL Dogtag PKI packages for Fedora:
* yum &#91;--enablerepo=updates-testing&#93; upgrade &lt;package&gt;<br><br>
<br>
If a 'local' directory server is to be utilized on EPEL (see http://directory.fedoraproject.org/docs/389ds/download.html for details):
* yum &#91;--enablerepo=epel-testing&#93; install 389-ds<br><br>
To obtain ALL Dogtag PKI packages for EPEL:
* yum &#91;--enablerepo=epel-testing&#93; install dogtag-pki<br><br>
To obtain INDIVIDUAL Dogtag PKI packages for EPEL:
* yum &#91;--enablerepo=epel-testing&#93; upgrade &lt;package&gt;<br><br>
