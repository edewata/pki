= Overview =

This page describes the process to release JSS on Fedora.

= Authentication =

Obtain a Kerberos ticket for FEDORAPROJECT.ORG account and [[COPR]] authentication token.

= Getting Source Package =

The repository for JSS source package for Fedora is located at https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/jss. To clone the repository locally:

 $ fedpkg clone jss
 $ cd jss

The repository can be forked for development. To add the fork into the local repository:

 $ git remote add <username> ssh://<username>@pkgs.fedoraproject.org/forks/<username>/rpms/jss.git
 $ git fetch <username>

= Updating Version and Release Numbers =

Follow this guideline to update the version number, release number, and phase in the [https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss/blob/master/jss.spec.in spec template]:

* version: <x>.<y>.<z>
* release: 0.1, 0.2, ..., 1, 2, ...
* phase: a1, a2, ..., b1, b2, ...

For pre-releases, set the version number to <x>.<y>.0, set the release number to 0.<n>, and phase to -<phase>:

<pre>
Version:        4.5.0
Release:        0.1%{?_timestamp}%{?_commit_id}%{?dist}
%global         _phase -a1
</pre>

For initial release, keep the version number as <x>.<y>.0, set the release number to 1, and comment out the phase:

<pre>
Version:        4.5.0
Release:        1%{?_timestamp}%{?_commit_id}%{?dist}
# %global       _phase -a1
</pre>

For upstream updates (i.e. upstream bug fixes), increment the <z> in the version number, set the release number to 1:

<pre>
Version:        4.5.1
Release:        1%{?_timestamp}%{?_commit_id}%{?dist}
# %global       _phase -a1
</pre>

For downstream patches (e.g. platform-specific patches), keep the version number as <x>.<y>.<z>, increment the release number:

<pre>
Version:        4.5.1
Release:        2%{?_timestamp}%{?_commit_id}%{?dist}
# %global       _phase -a1
</pre>

= Merging Spec Changes =

To merge the spec template with the actual spec files:

 $ meld <font color="red">jss</font>/jss.spec <font color="red">Fedora/jss</font>/jss.spec 

In the actual spec files, add a change log entry for the new release in downstream spec file (unless there is one already that has not been released):

 * Tue May 29 2018 Dogtag PKI Team <pki-devel@redhat.com> - 4.4.4-1
 - Rebased to JSS 4.4.4

'''Notes:'''
* Do not override changes that were done downstream unless they were done improperly.
* Do not add a change log entry in the upstream spec template.
* There might be changes that cannot be merged. This is OK.

= Commit Upstream Changes =

Commit all changes to upstream:

 $ git commit -a -m "Updated version number to x.y.z-r"

Create a local tag with the following commands:

 $ git tag v4.4.4

For pre-releases, append the phase name to the version number, e.g. v4.4.0-a1.

= Update Source Tarball =

Generate a tarball with the following commands:

 $ cd <font color="red">jss</font>
 $ ./build.sh --source-tag=v4.5.0 src

Import the source tarball with the following commands:

 $ cd <font color="red">Fedora/jss</font>
 $ fedpkg new-sources ~/build/jss/SOURCES/jss-4.5.0.tar.gz

Then verify with the following commands:

 $ fedpkg local
 $ fedpkg lint

= Creating Test Build =

Create a [[COPR]] build with the following command:

 $ cd <font color="red">Fedora/jss</font>
 $ fedpkg copr-build @pki/10.6 --nowait

or create a scratch build with the following commands:

 $ fedpkg srpm
 $ fedpkg scratch-build --nowait --srpm jss-4.4.5-1.fc28.src.rpm

Once the test build is complete, push the changes and tag upstream:

 $ cd <font color="red">jss</font>
 $ git push origin master
 $ git push origin v4.4.4

= Commit Source Package Changes =

Commit the changes to master (i.e. rawhide):

 $ cd <font color="red">Fedora/jss</font>
 $ git commit -m "Rebased to JSS 4.4.4"
 $ git push origin master

= Creating Koji Build for Rawhide =

Create a Koji build:

 $ fedpkg build --nowait

If necessary, the task can be monitored with the following command:

 $ koji watch-task <task ID>

Once the build is complete, tag the source package repository:

 $ git tag jss-4.4.4-1.fc29
 $ git push origin jss-4.4.4-1.fc29

= Creating Koji Build for Current Fedora =

Cherry pick the changes from master into the current Fedora (e.g. f28):

 $ git checkout <branch>
 $ git cherry-pick <commit ID>
 $ git push origin <branch>

Then create a Koji build:

 $ fedpkg build --nowait

If necessary, the task can be monitored with the following command:

 $ koji watch-task <task ID>

Tag package repository:

 $ git tag jss-4.4.4-1.fc28
 $ git push origin jss-4.4.4-1.fc28

= Creating Bodhi Update for Current Fedora =

Once the Koji build is complete, submit a Bodhi update:

 $ bodhi updates new \
  --request=testing \
  --notes="Update to JSS 4.4.4-1" \
  --type=enhancement jss-4.4.4-1.fc28

The update will appear [https://bodhi.fedoraproject.org/updates/?packages=jss here].

= Creating GitHub Release =

Go to https://github.com/dogtagpki/jss/releases/tag/v4.4.4 and edit the release.

Include links to the new releases:

* https://src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/jss/releases
