Review: The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings Enhanced Edition

The Witcher 1 and 2 was a PC only game which created good reputation itself using a combination of dynamic RPG gameplay including a mature approach to storytelling. The Enhanced Edition with the Witcher 2 brings this not just to your computer for a free update, but additionally into the Xbox 360 console where find our protagonist Geralt of Rivia wrongly accused of murdering a king. Luckily, being a witcher they have all the powers of a warrior mage and sets about aiming to prove his innocence.

Combat is indeed a treat thanks to by an excellent control system that while taking some getting used to, gives an excellent a feeling of control once learned. The application of magic spells ('signs') is restricted by your vigor meter and for that reason you have to cleverly switch between this and swordplay, which ensures you keep the gameplay varied. In addition to sword based parrying and thrusting, you may as well use items from a quick inventory like bombs and throwing daggers which delay time when you aim. Flicking the proper stick down or up switches between nearest and furthest targets and lets you effortlessly switch between enemies in front and behind you. Adding yet further for the excellent combat could be the traps you may make which lend the fights a strategic element, while you prepare yourself to lure enemies into them.

Element of a witcher's skill is in his potion making which is useful to enhance a weapon's damage, create healing potions as well as to make all sorts of other special ability enhancing mixes. Gathering the resources of these is not a chore in minimally because of witcher's medallion. Pressing the left stick in is likely to make Geralt touch his medallion revealing your local resources available. Which reveals any items that can be looted and points the way to any nearby doors or areas to generally be explored. This is a brilliant technique of providing optional assist to the player without pointing everything out on their behalf. It can be nearly little leaguer to make the decision if they desire to use it you aren't. One minor gripe is that the minimap is certainly not easy to read and the items on the map are hard to differentiate from a single together with other when close together.

Leveling up gives you a skills tree that stretches out in various directions (swordsmanship, alchemy, magic, etc) thereby letting the gamer choose how they wish to level up their witcher and adding replay value for the game.

Quests in the game cover anything from enjoyable set-piece battles, protect-the-target style operations, resource gathering tasks and more. They all are enjoyable and well considered with side-quests sometimes helping you in the main storyline by making life easier. One example is, while on an opening quest I required time out to help a new soldier who later distracted some guards in my situation like a thanks a ton. This interweaving of side and main quests encourages the player to explore the game to the fullest and it's another instance of good game design. Although generally annoying in most games, the quick-time events which happen from time to time absolutely are a fun, inclusive event that further conserve the player feel portion of events. Whether running clear of a dragon or aiming an enormous crossbow all of them are smartly woven into your game.

CD Projekt Red have said that believe that that this is among the best looking Xbox games on his or her market and i am inclined to trust them. Within the opening movie the visuals are impressive and lend an air of reality to the world of the witcher, within the muted greens and browns in the forest to your shadowy confines of any dungeon jail. Sweeping vistas and boggy swamps are all spectacularly rendered and imposing castles tower above you. Character animation is superbly detailed and the game contains a lived-in, earthy look generates you believe a natural part of a medieval world where life could be dirty and unpleasant. Or bright and glorious, provided you're noble.

Leading to the gritty feel there may be loads of bad language and nudity but here it feels appropriate on the tone and spirit of the planet the fact that game is portraying. This one thing doesn't generate a mature game of course, though the storyline is thought provoking and adult in the process and so i would feel safe describing the games content as mature. With dialogue choices the Witcher 2 swallows a more interesting view by not indicating which options the 'good' choice, giving a moral ambiguity that compliments a dark tone of the game.

Many of you reading this article may already own The Witcher 2 on PC and therefore are wondering what's different in the Enhanced Edition. Well, the answer is about 4 hours of new gameplay (taking total gameplay to a number exceeding 45 hours) and A half hour of cutscenes which includes new quests, new characters and locations. There've recently been over 100 fixes and improvements for all parts of the game.
