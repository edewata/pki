Will it be earrings? A pendant? A bracelet? A ring? If money's an issue, earrings or a pendant necklace,<br>particularly if we're discussing great precious jewelry, are undoubtedly the most cost effective pieces of precious jewelry. For the inexperienced, you can easily convert 'fine precious jewelry' to suggest anything that has a K in it - as in 10k gold, 12k gold, 14k gold, etc. Earrings are pretty self-explanatory.

We've got to lose this notion that an <br>individual who receives an 18k gold ring is more loved than an individual who gets a 10k ring.<br>It's ludicrous.<br><br>If the budget can not accommodate a present of fine precious jewelry, then consider Sterling silver jewelry.

Or you can easily stick with straight Sterling, no gemstones, and discover your buck will certainly go quite far.

It does not matter if she wore dangling earrings one time and you loved it. She's got to enjoy it.<br>The present is for her satisfaction, not yours.<br><br>Caution: Exactly how to state this perfectly? Stay away from giving <br>rings unless you imply company. Females get gifts of precious jewelry a whole lot throughout <br>their life times - it comes from buddies (both male and female), family, co-workers, supervisors - all kinds of ways.<br>And it's all great and appropriate because most of what we receive is along the lines of 'impersonal' precious jewelry - the earrings, the pins and brooches, the pendants, the bracelets - none of which conveys anything beyond, "Hey I like you and I think this'll look really good on you.<br>" Rings are an entirely different matter - particularly [http://www.communicationdesign.info/2012/07/anklets-proving-to-be-popular-so-more-added/ from this source] gold rings. And when you shove that little ring box under our noses, our hearts begin to pound. Either with trepidation (if we don't like you a lot) or with pleasure (if we like you a lot). But it pounds. Due to the fact that a ring, for whatever explanation, is a significantly individual piece of jewelry originating from a guy. It delivers a message. Believe me, even in this day and age of enlightened communication between the sexes, it sends a message. Unless you're up for it, stick with earrings or a good bracelet.<br><br>Now let me complicate things a bit: The whole previous paragraph admonishing against giving rings goes out the window if your sweetheart is the type that's into sterling silver and semiprecious stones. Sterling silver precious jewelry is more easygoing (picture silver and turquoise or silver and coral precious jewelry for instance) and does not often tend to transmit any sort of hidden message. If your girlfriend likes Sterling silver and likes a range of semiprecious stones, it's perfectly great to add an additional ring to her collection.<br><br>Action Three: Store, store, shop! Nuisance yourself out to a jewelry shop and do some looking. Doing the actual purchase online is a great concept and will probably save you cash, too, as online jewelry shops enable you to contrast store quickly and don't usually have the overhead linked with a brick and mortar shop, however truthfully, absolutely nothing beats actually seeing a couple of precious jewelry pieces in person. If the concept of setting foot in a jewelry store is unnerving, then try a division shop. If you see a style you like, ask exactly what it's called. "Exactly what kind of configuration is that?<br>Just what kind of stone is that? Just how big is that stone?<br>" are all excellent questions. Pay unique attention to the estimated gemstone size. It's tough to envision a 4mm stone or a 1 carat stone when you're looking at a pc screen. Seeing one in individual is a completely different matter. Take your mental notes on just what you have actually seen, then hightail it back to your computer system and do some serious contrast shopping. This applies whether you're shopping for silver or gold, valuable or semiprecious gemstones.<br><br>Lastly, when you're ready to buy, review the fine print at the bottom! Exactly what's the return policy on the precious jewelry? Exactly what does the internet site (or store) state about the gemstone quality? Can the ring (if you decide to buy a ring) be resized quickly?<br><br>And that's it! With a little forethought and planning, you'll be able to pick a cost effective jewelry gift for your sweetheart that will match her character and design and that she ensures to love. And if she does't, you understand the shop's return policy. Pleased shopping!
