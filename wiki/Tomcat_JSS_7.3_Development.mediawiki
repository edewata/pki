= Overview =

This page describes the development process for Tomcat JSS 7.3 or later. For other versions see [[Tomcat JSS Development]].

= Source Code =

To clone the source repository:

<pre>
$ git clone git@github.com:dogtagpki/tomcatjss.git
$ cd tomcatjss
</pre>

By default it will checkout the master branch.

To list available branches:

<pre>
$ git branch -r
</pre>

To switch to a different branch:

<pre>
$ git checkout <branch>
</pre>

= Dependencies =

During development Tomcat JSS may require dependencies that are only available in [https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/wiki/COPR-Repositories COPR Repositories].

To enable PKI COPR repository:

<pre>
$ dnf copr -y enable @pki/10.6
</pre>

To install Tomcat JSS dependencies:

<pre>
$ dnf builddep -y --spec tomcatjss.spec
</pre>

= Building Tomcat JSS Packages =

To build Tomcat JSS packages:

<pre>
$ ./build.sh [OPTIONS] [target]
</pre>

Available targets:
* src: build RPM sources (tarball and patch)
* spec: build RPM spec and everything above
* srpm: build SRPM package and everything above
* rpm: build RPM packages and everything above (default)

The default working directory is $HOME/build/jss. During the build process the following subfolders will be created:
* BUILD: contains unpacked source code
* BUILDROOT: contains installed binaries
* RPMS: contains the binary packages
* SOURCES: contains the tarball and patch files
* SPECS: contains the spec file
* SRPMS: contains the source package

To start the build process:

<pre>
$ ./build.sh
</pre>

It will build Tomcat JSS packages with the files in the local source directory.

The package version number and release number will be determined by the Version and Release attributes in the tomcatjss.spec.in.

== Changing Working Directory ==

To change the working directory:

<pre>
$ ./build.sh --work-dir=/tmp/tomcatjss
</pre>

== Adding Timestamp and Commit ID ==

To add the current timestamp and the latest commit ID of the current branch into the release number:

<pre>
$ ./build.sh --with-timestamp --with-commit-id
</pre>

== Changing Distribution Name ==

The default distribution name can be obtained with the following command:

 $ rpm --eval '%{dist}' | cut -c 2-

To change the distribution name:

 $ ./build.sh --dist=<name>

'''Note:''' The distribution name should not be prefixed with a dot (e.g. fc28).

== Building with Current Branch ==

To build with the code already checked into the current branch:

<pre>
$ ./build.sh --source-tag=HEAD
</pre>

This will produce the following source:
* tomcatjss-<version>.tar.gz: tarball containing the source code up to the HEAD of the branch

== Building with Patched Tarball ==

To build with a tarball and a patch file:

<pre>
$ ./build.sh --source-tag=v7.3.0
</pre>

This will produce the following sources:
* tomcatjss-<version>.tar.gz: a tarball containing the source code tagged with v7.3.0
* tomcatjss-<version>-<release>.patch: a combined patch containing all changes after v7.3.0 up to HEAD

'''Notes:'''
* Do not specify a tag that does not exist in the current branch.
* The patch can be split into smaller patches if necessary.
* It may be possible to add another option to generate separate patch for each commit instead of a combined one.

= Installing Tomcat JSS Packages =

To install Tomcat JSS packages:

<pre>
$ dnf install $HOME/build/tomcatjss/RPMS/*
</pre>
