= Issue =

Currently PKI cannot run inside OpenShift due to the following issues:

* pkispawn needs to run as root
* OpenShift requires containers to run as non-root (except during initialization in Dockerfile)
* pkispawn needs systemd for installation and runtime
* OpenShift doesn't support systemd (except after running /usr/sbin/init at the end of Dockerfile)

= Solution =

Remove PKI's dependency on systemd for installation and runtime.

== Installation ==

Convert the configuration servlets into CLIs that can run without starting the server:

* pki-server config-init
* pki-server db-setup
* pki-server cert-setup
* pki-server admin-setup
* pki-server nssdb-backup
* pki-server sd-setup
* pki-server db-user-setup
* pki-server config-finalize

== Runtime ==

Provide a CLI to run the server in the foreground:

* pki-server run

= Tasks =

* Refactor installation code not to depend on CMSEngine.
* Refactor configuration servlets into CLIs.
* Update installation code to use the CLIs instead of servlets (without systemd).
* Add CLI to run PKI server in the foreground (without systemd).
* Create Dockerfile to call pkispawn and then run the server in the foreground.
* Publish PKI server image on DockerHub.
* Deploy PKI server on OpenShift for demo.
