== Java Runtime Environments ==

A java runtime environment (JRE) is required to run the PKI java-tools, the pki-console, or the CA, DRM, OCSP, or TKS subsystems.  Select the appropriate JRE based upon the operating system being utilized.

=== Fedora 9, Fedora 10, Fedora 11, etc. ===

The CA, DRM, OCSP, and TKS subsystems, PKI java tools, and PKI console  require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) [http://openjdk.java.net Open JRE 1.6] '''java''' to be used:

 yum install java-1.6.0-openjdk

To insure that the appropriate version of '''java''' has been selected, become the '''root''' user, and run the following '''/usr/sbin/alternatives''' command to verify that this '''java''' has been selected.  For example:

 '''/usr/sbin/alternatives --config java'''
You will see output like this:
 There are 2 programs which provide 'java'.
 
   Selection    Command
 -----------------------------------------------
 *+ 1           /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.6.0-openjdk/bin/java
    2           /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.5.0-gcj/bin/java
 
 Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number:

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top">'''IMPORTANT:&nbsp;&nbsp;'''</td>
<td>Additionally, be sure that the '''JAVA_HOME''' and '''CLASSPATH''' environment variables are unset in the user's command-line shell, and that the '''PATH''' environment variable does not reference a '''java''' executable that is different than the one set by the '''/usr/sbin/alternatives''' command.  This can be checked by running the command '''which java''' which should return '''/usr/bin/java''' and/or the command '''java -version''' which should return the expected Java version.</td>
</tr>

=== Fedora 8 ===

The CA, DRM, OCSP, and TKS subsystems, PKI java tools, and PKI console  require the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) [http://icedtea.classpath.org IcedTea Open JRE 1.7] '''java''' to be used:

 yum install java-1.7.0-icedtea

To insure that the appropriate version of '''java''' has been selected, become the '''root''' user, and run the following '''/usr/sbin/alternatives''' command to verify that this '''java''' has been selected.  For example:

 '''/usr/sbin/alternatives --config java'''
You will see output like this:
 There are 2 programs which provide 'java'.
 
   Selection    Command
 -----------------------------------------------
 *+ 1           /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.7.0-icedtea/bin/java
    2           /usr/lib/jvm/jre-1.5.0-gcj/bin/java
 
 Enter to keep the current selection[+], or type selection number:

=== Fedora Core 6 and Fedora 7 ===

The IBM Java JRE 5.0 is required to run most PKI subsystems. Please download the jpackage format (e.g. pxi32dev-20080315-jpackage.tar.gz) version from the following URL:

* [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/jdk/linux/download.html IBM's J2SE 5.0]
You may need to create an account to complete the download task.

After downloading the package, unpack it and install it:
 gunzip pxi32dev-20080315-jpackage.tar.gz
 tar xvf pxi32dev-20080315-jpackage.tar
 rpm -iv java-1.5.0-ibm-1.5.0.7-1jpp.i386.rpm 
Use whatever architecture you are using instead of i386 if different.

<table>

<td valign="top">'''NOTE:&nbsp;&nbsp;'''</td>
<td>Certain versions of the IBM JRE (e. g. - "java-1.5.0-ibm-1.5.0.5-1jpp") require the C++ compatibility library (e. g. - "compat-libstdc++"), or the following error may be seen at runtime ("libstdc++.so.5 cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory").  To eliminate this potential issue, users may need to install the following package:</td>

To insure that the appropriate version of '''java''' has been selected, become the '''root''' user, and run the following '''/usr/sbin/alternatives''' command to verify that this '''java''' has been selected.  For example:

 '''/usr/sbin/alternatives --config java'''
You should then see output like this:

== Apache Web Server ==

The RA and TPS subsystems require the use of the system's default Apache web server.
