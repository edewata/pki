How to prevent Choosing the Wrong Architect



Finding an architect could be perilous business, and because of the high-stakes nature of architecture in general it is extremely important that (before you begin looking for the best architect) you learn what to look for in an architect. Now, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) has compiled a summary of twenty questions you should ask any prospective architect before you think about employing him/her to complete your project- however, whilst their email list is very helpful, (and should probably be the very first thing you read in preparation for the architect hunt) it isn't all-inclusive.

With this in mind, here are some further tips that might be of use to you during your search.

1. Visit the architect's office. Your architect will likely be inclined to work from an area they find visually pleasing. Any initial meeting will probably take place at the planned work site, but consider scheduling a follow-up at their office before finalising any deals.

2. A disorganized architect's office might be a red flag. If you discover the office to be a complete mess, it might indicate an over-all lack of organisational skill. Having lots of models and sketches around the office doesn't invariably count as they possibly can remain dotted around a workspace to promote creativity. However, documents along with other project information should really be filed away properly.

3. Ask your architect which 3D software they're using. Any good architect should be utilizing a software program called "BIM" (Building Information Model) to design their buildings. BIM helps architects to create their projects entirely in three dimensions and it is especially useful when you are maintaining uniform sizes in doors and windows. As a result it is a great assist in avoiding errors within the initial design.

5. Know your architect. This sounds like a no-brainer, but when you're attempting to hire an architect from a firm that employs several then it's crucial that you talk with the very person you're about to hire. Its not all architect has the same degree of know-how and creative ability, and it's crucial that you feel safe in the knowledge that your architect shares how well you see for that project.

6. Try to understand a few of their previous drawings. Architect's drawings can be very hard to understand if you have never had to read them before. However, a good architect should be able to present their ideas in design-form that (after they have been fully explained to you) make complete sense. If this is not the situation, the architect may either not be capable of communicating very well, otherwise 't be producing particularly good drawings in the first place.

As we mentioned earlier, time spent searching for the best architect isn't time wasted. Actually, the chances are whatever time you spend in your search will save countless hours later when your project commences- be prepared to include a great deal of time and energy and the results will speak on their own. Happy hunting!
