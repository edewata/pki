The object system in a Java Card is partitioned into separate protected object spaces referred to as contexts. All applets in a given package share the same context, and are prohibited from accessing objects in a different context due to firewalls which are enforced by the Java Card Runtime Environment (JCRE) [ 8 ]. The JCRE is able to access objects in any context, and global arrays such as the APDU buffer (which are owned by the JCRE) can be accessed by applets in any context.
