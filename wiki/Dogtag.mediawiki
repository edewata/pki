=== Revised Branch Names ===
On September 16, 2014, the PKI git repository branches were renamed to follow our new naming conventions:

The following table shows the corresponding platform vs. product version vs. branch names:

The following describes the branching philosophy associated with packaging:

* [[Package Versioning]]

=== Example of Updating an Existing Branch that has been Previously Checked-Out ===
(1) Identify the local branch
    # git branch
    IPA_V3_RHEL_7_ERRATA_BRANCH
(2) Rename the local branch
    # git branch -m IPA_V3_RHEL_7_ERRATA_BRANCH DOGTAG_10_0_RHEL_BRANCH
(3) Identify the local branch
    # git branch
    DOGTAG_10_0_RHEL_BRANCH
(4) Attempt to update the local branch from the remote branch
    # git pull
    . . .
    Your configuration specifies to merge with the ref 'IPA_V3_RHEL_7_ERRATA_BRANCH'
    from the remote, but no such ref was fetched.
(5) Setup remote upstream tracking on the branch you just renamed
    # git branch -u origin/DOGTAG_10_0_RHEL_BRANCH
    Branch DOGTAG_10_0_RHEL_BRANCH set up to track remote branch DOGTAG_10_0_RHEL_BRANCH from origin.
(6) Attempt to update the local branch from the remote branch
    # git pull
    Already up-to-date.

The fedorahosted.org sunset on Tuesday, February 28, 2017; this involved migration of the numerous products away from the use of its TRAC Issue Trackers, storage of various SVN and GIT repositories, and movement away from TRAC Wiki material:
