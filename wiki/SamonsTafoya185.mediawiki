Directory Links for Web Promotion

This really is good; it provides you with an improved chance at being listed based on the category or subcategory of your business as opposed to just by keywords you use in your website.

In exchange for listing your business within their directory, you're expected to provide a backlink to their directory. The two-way linking is helpful for being noticed by search engines like google, that also boosts your ranking in searches, so it is a win-win for both sides. The various search engines might take their sweet time in discovering your website otherwise; they are doing regular visits to the directories.
