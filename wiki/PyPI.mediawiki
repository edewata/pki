= Creating PyPI Release =

== Prepare your system ==

Install package requirements

<pre>
dnf install python-setuptools python-wheel
</pre>

Store PyPI credentials in ~/.pypirc

<pre>
[distutils]
index-servers =
    pypi

[pypi]
username: <username>
password: <password>
</pre>

== Build and upload release to PyPI ==

Create the release with the following commands:

<pre>
$ cd base/common/python
$ python setup.py release
</pre>

To inspect the files before they are uploaded, do:

<pre>
$ cd base/common/python
$ python setup.py packages
$ ls dist/
</pre>

The ''packages'' and ''release'' aliases are defined in ''setup.cfg''. It creates a source distribution and universal wheel. Then it registers a new version of the package and uploads both files to PyPI. A file can only uploaded once. PyPI refused to replace a file. 

''setup.py'' gets the version and release from specs/pki-core.spec. The Python script rewrites itself to include the version number in setup.py and to make the source distribution work without specs/pki-core.spec. '''Please revert changes to setup.py afterwards.'''
