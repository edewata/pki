==Goal of this page==
Is this page about:
# Migrating keys from an OpenSSL CA to Dogtag, -or-
# Obtaining a certificate for an existing personal cert/key

The title suggestions #1 (Reuse Existing CA Keypair), but the text suggests #2.

== Can we doc using pk12util? ==

I'd rather use pk12util than openssl for examples.
