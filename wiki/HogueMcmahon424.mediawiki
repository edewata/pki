While vinyl is really a popular material, many homeowners are choosing to go with a classical choice and this implies that they're using wood for the interior of each window. However, the choices don't end there.

Selecting a Standard Finish Or perhaps a Field Finish

Although it might seem like this process is backwards, customers first should determine whether they're planning on using standard finishes or if they would like to possess a finish applied in their house for each window. This is because certain types of wood are harder to use a custom stain on, which should immediately eliminate those species for many homeowners.

The option between standard and a field finish depends on the number of different factors, such as the kind of trim you have in your house and the connection with your window replacement company. For those who have standard light oak baseboards, banisters and more in your house, you will probably be able to order doors and windows which have been prefinished by the manufacturer. In case your woodwork is dark or otherwise unique, it may be a better option to have it custom stained to complement.

Unfortunately these variations aren't often realized before the windows and doors are installed and also the stain is applied. Instead of going for a chance and coping with an inside finish that might not be what homeowners envisioned, many are deciding to pick a different species of wood for their windows' interiors.

Additionally, oak and maple are simpler to stain, which makes it better to complement woodwork that's already inside the house. The cost increase is often negligible; especially once homeowners consider the difference it can make in the manner their interior looks.
