The three Sad Truths About Internet Porn



With the rise of porn on the Internet, many "free" web filters also began turning up. If you've ever used one of these simple free filters you'll know that they are rubbish. And many of these have lacking features you need to purchase to use. So ultimately you wind up spending money on that which you thought you had been getting into the initial place! Now there are 3 reasons why free porn blockers are a total waste of time, and i am sharing all of them with you.

Could they be Really "Free"?

Most "no cost" web filters don't present each of the features it promised initially. It's basically a marketing tool, to give you "a taste" of what the actual filter is all about. And after using this "incomplete" porn blocker, they'll start asking you to purchase bonus packs and other additional software. You might not realize this, however the porn industry is a big industry. They have been in this business quite a long time, plus they know exactly how to design their adult content to slide "under the nets" of web filters, as well as a FREE ones! They use various methods of getting their content onto your computer... without the use of a website. All they need offers some misspelled URLs, email links, and Pop-ups to dump their trash on your desktop. These are merely a number of the basic tactics that porn industries use to entice men and boys. So what's the utilization of downloading a totally free web-filtering software?

Ineffective Website Blocking

There are no guarantees that the web filter can block all porn because hey, it's free! Should you have had a filter that blocked out sites containing only mature words and porn company names, all of the porn workers have to do is misspell their site's domain name (as mentioned above), or they might simply give their website a neutral name like "White House". The keyword "Playboy" would obviously get blocked, but a keyword like "White House"... absolutely not.

File Sharing Sites

A free porn blocker is not able to block file-sharing websites. Exactly what is a file sharing site, and why do you need to block them? File-sharing sites are where people may come and download free music, videos, games, and just about anything else that's downloadable. But these sites are illegal. They contain free music that somebody else taken care of (the same thing goes for movies). If you can download almost anything at file-sharing sites, then what about porn movie clips? Absolutely.

So now you can observe why free web filters are surely a waste of time. But there's more bad news. The majority of the "paid" (yes paid) porn blockers are just badly as if it were a totally free one. They can't stop the examples mentioned above. So what will you do to protect your family?
