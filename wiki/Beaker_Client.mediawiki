The following steps help setup a beaker client for creating the task rpm and submitting the beaker job to the beaker server.

= Installation =

Copy the file [https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/blob/master/tests/dogtag/conf/beaker-client.cfg tests/dogtag/conf/beaker-client.repo] to
/etc/yum.repos.d. Replace <version> with the version of Fedora. Run this command to find the Fedora version:

 cat /etc/fedora-release

Execute the following command:

 $ yum install expect beakerlib beaker-client rhts-devel

Create a folder /etc/beaker and copy the file [https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/blob/master/tests/dogtag/conf/client.conf tests/dogtag/conf/client.conf] to that folder.

Update the client.conf file with [[Beaker Server]]'s authentication details.

For an Username/Password authentication enter values for HUB_URL, USERNAME, PASSWORD.
The sample file has been configured for using this setting as default.

For a Kerberos authentication, comment the AUTH_METHOD="password",
USERNAME and PASSWORD fields uncomment and enter the values for
HUB_URL and KRB_REALM and uncomment the line AUTH_METHOD="krbv".

This sets up the machine as a beaker client, on which new task rpms can
be built and new jobs submitted to the beaker server.
