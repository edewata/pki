= Overview =

This page is being moved into https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki/wiki/Setting-Up-Eclipse.

= Getting Eclipse =

Yum install eclipse-platform eclipse-jdt
 eclipse-cdt for C/C++ 
but that is a tale for another day
Tomcat not included either

= Getting JEE For Eclipse =

Help->Install New Software
Repository:Indigo
URL http://Download.eclipse.org/releases/indigo
Install New Software -> Web, XML  and Java EE Developer

= Tomcat Instance =

*User is you:  Directory under your control:
*The PKI Tomcat instance is very customized:  Much easier to use the tomcat instance created by pkicreate than to try and make your own or work with one downloaded by eclipse.

== Creating the Tomcat Instance ==

sudo pkicreate  
-pki_instance_root=$HOME/apps  
-subsystem_type=ca   
-pki_instance_name=pki-ca-dev  
-secure_port=8443   
-unsecure_port=8080 
-tomcat_server_port=8005  
-user=$USER -group=$USER -verbose

== Symlinks ==

* demo-pki-ca -> /etc/rc.d/init.d/tomcat6
* bin -> /usr/share/tomcat6/bin
* lib -> /usr/share/tomcat6/lib
* Remove webapps/ca/WEB-INF/lib/pki*\
* Symlink webapps/ca/WEB-INF/classes to pki project in Eclipse

= Runtime Environment =

* Windows->Preferences->Server->Runtime Environments
* add a “Runtime Environment”  : tomcat6
* choose the directory that pkicreate put the tomcat instance in.  
* If you missed one of the symlinks, it will give you and angry icon

= Server Project =

== Create Server Project ==

* File->New->Other->Server->Server Project
-- OR --
* Window->Perspectives->Other->JEE
* Right click in Server View

== Server View ==

* JEE Perspective: server view
* tab on the bottom of the window
* double click it and you should get a property sheet in the main window
* “Use Tomcat Installation”
* Open launch configuration
* Classpath
* under user entries: Add tomcat-juli.jar

= Debugging =

Link Source  To PKI
Breakpoint in  known path of the application
