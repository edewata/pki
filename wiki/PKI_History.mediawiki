== Netscape Certificate Server 1.0 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[01/24/1997] ==

The Certificate System project was created at Netscape Communications when a need arose to generate certificates as a better means of authentication rather than using simple name/password based basic authentication.  Released on January 24, 1997, version 1.0 of the Netscape Certificate Server was written in a combination of C, and C++, and used an Informix database for storage of the certificates.  The release consisted solely of a Certificate Authority, and was made available on a number of different hardware platforms.

== Netscape Certificate Management System 4.1 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[06/24/1999] ==

Shortly thereafter, a group of Netscape engineers decided to create a more robust framework consisting of a plug-in architecture.  Released on June 24, 1999, Netscape Certificate Management System was written primarily in Java (with small portions in C and C++), and would replace the proprietary third-party Informix Database with the successful Netscape Directory Server.  This release consisted of three subsystems, a Certificate Authority, a Data Recovery Manager, and a Registration Authority. Due to the new code base, the number of available hardware platforms was significantly reduced from the 1.0.x version.

== Red Hat Certificate System 7.2 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[02/05/2007] ==

On February 5, 2007, Red Hat Certificate System 7.2 was released, and was changed significantly from being one huge monolithic package of various embedded servers and subsystems into numerous modular independent RPMs/PKGs.  While still required for operation, the Red Hat Directory Server was removed as an embedded server and required to be obtained as a separate downloadable entity, and the reliance upon the Netscape Enterprise Security web server was replaced by version 2.0 of the Apache web server, and version 5.5 of the Tomcat web server.  This server was made available on both 32-bit and 64-bit Red Hat Enterprise Linux 4 AS/ES, and 64-bit sparcv9 Solaris 9 platforms.
