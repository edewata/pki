Steps to make The Best Green tea extract



Green tea extract is a beverage made by steeping green tea extract leaves in hot or warm water. It is drunk recreationally, to maintain alertness or for health advantages.

It has caffeine, plus other phytochemicals like flavonoids, polyphenols and catechins which are considered by some to supply many health advantages.

It also contains caffeine - a stimulant. A single cup of green tea extract contains under your average cup of drip coffee.

Making Green Tea

Preparing an excellent brew requires following certain rules. Actually, a few of these rules happen to be observed for centuries and therefore are deeply ingrained in tradition of tea cultures in many regions all over the world.

Using the Correct Tea Hardware

Traditional preparation of green tea calls for certain accessories. For both aesthetics and practical purposes.

Gaiwan - a sizable bowl with flared edges. It's accustomed to retain the water and tea leaves, employed for infusing. It features a lid and saucer; the lid is used to block the leaves while drinking the tea completely from the Gaiwan. The very best ones are made from Yixing clay or jade.

Teapots - traditionally made from porcelain or clay, also employed for steeping the tea. Teapot is never employed for boiling water for tea or boiling water with tea.

Cup - green tea could be obtained from the cup, filled in the Gaiwan. There are many styles of tea cups, but the best ones are manufactured from glazed porcelain to retain heat.

Today, traditional hardware is mainly substituted for modern accessories like tea balls, strainers, tea bags and smart tea makers. So, use the best option you have available.

Use The Best Water

Water quality is essential for your beverage. When possible, use spring water, not distilled water. Water you use dramatically influences the flavour and also the aroma of your tea.

Temperature of water

Use water heated to 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). This is cooler than full boiling point. You can usually tell visually: when little bubble appear on the top of water you are in the right ballpark.

Be sure to boil your water in a non-reactive pot. Ideally something made from glass or stainless.

Quantity Per Cup

The measurement for any perfect cup of is beautifully easy to remember: Use 1 Teaspoon (5 grams) per drinking cup of tea.

Steeping

You need to allow it to steep for 2 or three minutes. Any longer and you're likely to end up with a bitter cup.

Enjoy

Take away the tea in the water and allow it to stay for a few minutes and revel in your perfect cup of green tea.
