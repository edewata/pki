What's up?  My name is Latonya Farmer. I've been out of work for somewhere around six months now, and I need to maintain my typing and editing skills or I'll never be able to get back to work. I'm looking forward to forcing my brain to work again. Since I'm still kind of new around here, I'd honestly be happy to get feedback on anything I bungle. I'm not really sure how that works, but I'll get it after a bit.
