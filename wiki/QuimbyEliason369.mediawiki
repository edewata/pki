Ecigarette - Smoke Without Fire



Asked recently to create about electric cigarettes, I have to confess that I had never heard of such a thing. Some internet research later and I discovered that electric cigarettes are very much a quickly growing concern. A Google search revealed there isn't any smoke without fire as almost six million results just for the phrase "electronic cigarette" were returned.

What's an e-cigarette?

The ecigarette has been around existence for almost three years and it is a clever device aimed at providing smokers having a healthier option. Apparently also useful in assisting to reduce and even stop smoking altogether.

Now inside a fourth generation, electronic cigarettes have grown to be a lot more user friendly than earlier versions which perhaps were a tad too large to encourage full of market appeal. The "mini" is the most realistic e cigarette to date using its length of 100mm being just like a regular cigarette.

An e-cigarette contains a taste of tobacco but none of them from the harmful substances present in normal cigarettes allowing smokers cravings to be satisfied without inhaling the many dangerous toxins. Could it be all smoke and mirrors? Or can this item really be the saviour it really wants to be?

Battery power, an atomiser along with a renewable nicotine chamber allows the smoker to hold and smoke the ecigarette just like they would every other cigarette, even developing a "smoke" like vapour and glow at the end as they draw. The nicotine chamber proves very useful as cartridges can be found in different strengths, permitting the user to reduce the amount of nicotine they intake until when they wish, can quit completely.

A nicotine cartridge typically lasts the same time frame as 15-20 cigarettes, thus creating a huge saving to normalcy costs. Standard, medium, low and no nicotine whatsoever would be the various cartridge strengths.

A healthier option altogether it appears, although the benefits don't end there. Because of the ecigarette not emitting any dangerous substances, toxins or real smoke for that matter, they are perfectly legal to smoke in public. In the winter months particularly, normal cigarette smokers need to brave the freezing cold and the rain just for a quick smoking break but this alternative will allow them to remain in their offices, restaurants and pubs.

None smokers also will benefit, his or her worries about passive smoking are rendered null and void by the ecigarette. An infinitely more sociable environment then!

Upon reflection the electronic cigarette is really a healthier, cheaper and environmentally friendly option to smoking and because the awareness and also the market grows they have great possibility to successfully replace the harmful cigarettes most of us have come to know and many people have come to dread and fear.
