It takes both natural talent and also the drive to master skills in order to become a true tattoo artist.

Staring at the basics of drawing, painting, illustration, along with other types of visual art are an easy way to construct the abilities required to become a successful tattoo artist.

On-the-Job Training
There are some positive items to be said for building art skills right in the tattoo shop, and there are lots of opportunities. Even if you are not yet prepared to pick up a tattoo machine and put needles to skin, there are lots of opportunities to practice fundamental art skills within the shop. One of the easiest methods would be to start by creating stencils from flash designs that customers might choose. Tracing and dealing with these designs provides the aspiring tattoo artist a much better understanding of what's required for the task, as well as a first-hand feel for probably the most common motifs.

Once the aspiring artist has gotten knowledge about flash in the shop, he or she may start designing original flash. Again, this can help to hone skills as well as allows for the creation of a portfolio. The portfolio is extremely important when trying to get apprenticeships.

The Unique Art of Tattooing
As we said, the skill of tattooing shares many fundamentals along with other forms of visual art. Color theory, depth and perspective, composition, and many additional factors go into creating a great tattoo, just as they are doing with any drawing or painting. Obviously, there are a number of differences between the art of tattooing along with other visual art forms, too.

One of the most obvious difference is the canvas upon which the tattoo artist works. Instead of actual canvas or some sort of specialized paper, the tattoo artist imprints their creations on the skin of the living, breathing individual. This creates both challenges and benefits that other types of artists will never experience. For one thing, a tattoo artist's work constantly moves in one location to another, rather than being shown on a wall in a home or perhaps a museum or in the pages of a book.

Unlike other canvases, however, skin is very unforgiving. There is no erasing of mistakes or wasting an initial attempt and starting fresh on a new sheet of paper. Additionally, getting a tattoo can be rather uncomfortable, therefore the tattoo artist must constantly be familiar with the necessity to make his or her "canvas" much more comfortable or to reassure it. Dedicating oneself towards the art of tattooing necessitates the capability to use others and also to inspire and earn their trust.
