Unit testing is one way (of many) to test program code.  It focuses on the correctness of the individual functions that make up a program.  Each function is tested independently - and assumes that all other parts of the program operate correctly.  The most important thing to note is unit testing doesn't test that all the pieces work correctly together - that is the role of functional or integration testing.

PKI uses a [[Unit Test Framework]] based on [[JUnit]].
