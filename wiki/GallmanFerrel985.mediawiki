How to prevent Choosing the Wrong Architect



Finding an architect could be perilous business, and because of the high-stakes nature of architecture in general it is very essential that (before you begin looking for an architect) you learn excellent customer service within an architect. Now, the American Institute of Architects (AIA) has compiled a list of twenty things to ask any prospective architect before you think about employing him/her to complete your project- however, whilst their email list is very helpful, (and really should apt to be the very first thing you read in preparation for your architect hunt) it's not all inclusive.

With this thought, here are some further tips that might be of use to you during your search.

1. Go to the architect's office. Your architect will likely be inclined to work from an area they find visually pleasing. Any initial meeting will probably take place at the planned work site, but consider scheduling a follow up at their office before finalising any deals.

2. A disorganized architect's office might be a warning sign. If you find work to become a complete mess, it might indicate a general lack of organisational skill. Having lots of models and sketches around the office doesn't necessarily count as they can be kept dotted around a workspace to advertise creativity. However, documents along with other project information should really be filed away properly.

3. Ask your architect which 3D software they're using. Any good architect should be using a piece of software called "BIM" (Building Information Model) to design their buildings. BIM helps architects to design their projects entirely in three dimensions and is especially helpful in maintaining uniform sizes in windows and doors. As such it's a great help in avoiding errors in the initial design.

5. Know your architect. This sounds like a no-brainer, but when you're trying to hire an architect from the firm that employs several then it is crucial that you meet with the person you're about to hire. Not every architect has got the same level of know-how and creative ability, and it's crucial that you feel safe in the knowledge that your architect shares how well you see for the project.

6. Try to understand a few of their previous drawings. Architect's drawings can be very hard to understand if you've didn't have to read them before. However, a good architect should be able to present their ideas in design-form that (after they have been fully told you) make complete sense. If this isn't the case, the architect either can 't be able to communicating perfectly, or else not be producing particularly good drawings in the first place.

Once we mentioned earlier, time spent looking for the right architect is not time wasted. In fact, the chances are whatever time you spend during your search helps you to save countless hours later whenever your project commences- be ready to put in a lot of time and effort and the results will speak on their own. Happy hunting!
