Whilst just opinion the styling seems to get positive reactions through most people. It will never be mistaken for a few of competitors such as the Honda Social or Chevrolet Cruze. Because great since the car appears, this might be probably the most competitive segment inside the car company. This new Hyundai will need to fight challenging win devoted Honda and Toyota customers, along with pulled in front of the various less costly products.

Inside the car is spacious along with well merged The home heating and air flow controls within the centre stack are perfectly designed and originally organized, tend to be still quite simple to make use of.

Trunk space is, also it features split folding rear seats if you want more room.

Energy from the 148 horsepower 4 canister engine is actually pay towards the road via a 6-speed guide or automatic transmission. Our test car experienced the actual 6-speed automated with manual shift mode. The specific transmission is actually responsive and quick to change. Really the only complaint relates to the trunk suspension setup. It is far from fully self-employed, in contrast to competitors like the Cuze, Social and Concentrate. What this means is ride and handling over rough highways is compromised. Fuel economy is certainly one of the top priorities within this class, and also the Elantra promises to get the rest with 40 mpg based on the Usa rating program.
