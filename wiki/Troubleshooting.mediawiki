= Installation Issues =

== Check PKI Server Logs ==

To troubleshoot installation issues, the debug log level can be increased before running pkispawn. See [[PKI Server Log]].

== Common Issues ==

===  Misleading error message during installation ===

See [https://fedorahosted.org/pki/ticket/1615 Ticket #1615]. The PKI server generates the following message when it is started for the first time during installation before being configured by pkispawn:

<pre>
Sep 23 14:14:16 server.example.com server[13604]: CMS Warning: FAILURE: Cannot
build CA chain. Error java.security.cert.CertificateException: Certificate is
not a PKCS #11 certificate|FAILURE: authz instance DirAclAuthz initialization
failed and skipped, error=Property internaldb.ldapconn.port missing value|
</pre>

This is actually a normal part of the installation and can be ignored safely.

=== Failed token authentication ===

Installing an additional server may fail if the Directory Manager password, the PKCS #12 password, or the admin user was changed incorrectly. See the detailed steps at [http://www.freeipa.org/page/Howto/Change_Directory_Manager_Password IPA Howto: Changing Directory Manager Password].

= Cloning Issues =

* Check PKI server logs on master and replica
* Check certificate expirations
* Check Directory Manager password, admin password, and PKCS #12 password

= CLI Issues =

== Run in Verbose Mode ==

Run the CLI in verbose mode to see more details:

<pre>
$ pki -v <command>
</pre>

== Check HTTP Messages ==

Save the HTTP requests and responses exchanged by the CLI:

<pre>
$ mkdir -p tmp
$ pki --output tmp <command>
</pre>

== Check PKI Server Logs ==

CLI failure may be caused by a server issue. See [[PKI Server Log]].
