As the product gets bigger and complex, building and maintaining the product gets difficult. So is the case with Dogtag. Currently, we have a nightly infrastructure that runs in 2 stages:

* [[Nightly builds#PKI_Nightly_COPR_Build|Nightly COPR build]]
* [[Nightly builds#IPA_Nightly_test|IPA build]]

= Architecture =

The overall architecture of the new Nightly infrastructure:

= Configuring Travis =

COPR uses API token to authenticate for every srpm submitted. <font color='red'>pkijenkinsbot</font> has it's own API token. To install this API onto travis:

* Login into Travis
* Click on the ''' pki-nightly-test''' repo 
* Click on '''More Options''' -> '''Settings'''
* If there is a '''COPR_API''' key, delete it (click on trash can)
* Create a new key with name '''COPR_API''' and for value, follow the next steps
* Log into COPR website
* Get the API token from https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/api/

 [copr-cli]
 login = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 username = xxxxxxxx
 token = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
 copr_url = https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org"

* Copy & paste the contents of the API to a notepad
* At the end of every line place '\n' (without quotes)
* Make the entire key into a single line
* Add double quotes (") to the start and end of the line

 "[copr-cli]\nlogin = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\nusername = xxxxxxxx\ntoken = xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx\ncopr_url = https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org"

* Copy the entire line and paste into '''value''' field of step #5

= PKI Nightly COPR Build =

Nightly COPR builds for PKI are done through a cron job linked to https://github.com/dogtagpki/pki-nightly-test

== Under the hood ==

A fedora image is pulled from the official Fedora registry for building and uploading the SRPMs to COPR

Inside the container:
# COPR credentials and config is set
# Upstream PKI github repo is cloned
# `./build.sh --with-timestamp --with-commit-id --work-dir=/packages srpm` is executed
# `copr build /packages/*.src.rpm` is executed which submits the build to COPR `10.6-nightly` repo

= IPA Nightly test =

IPA uses components of Dogtag PKI to generate certificates, renew, etc. Cert related tests of IPA run every night. 

== Under the hood ==

There are 2 docker containers currently being spawned:

# To download the RPMS from COPR: It is just used to download the RPMS using `dnf` tool and copies the rpms to the host Travis machine
# `ipa-docker-test-runner` spawns the in-house maintained docker container (eg: f27_106_46 image available in dogtagpki/pki-ci) to run the ipa tests

= Future Work =

# Eliminate the use of docker image and avoid maintenance of docker repo (eg: dogtagpki/pki-ci) [DONE]
# Eliminate the use of `ipa-docker-test-runner` tool and instead run the ipa-tests using the [https://www.freeipa.org/page/Testing#Run_tests python3-ipatests] tool [DONE]
# Move the complete nightly builds from Travis to Gitlab to sync up with the QE team
