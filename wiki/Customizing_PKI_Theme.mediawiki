= Overview =

PKI theme contains the following:

* CSS files which determine the global appearance
* image files including logo, icons, etc.
* branding properties which determine the page title, logo link, title color, etc.

The subsystem web applications in the same instance share the same theme.

= Deployment =

The theme is deployed in Tomcat by creating /etc/pki/<font color="red">pki-tomcat</font>/Catalina/localhost/pki.xml:

<pre>
<Context docBase="/usr/share/pki/common-ui" crossContext="true" allowLinking="true">
    ...
</Context>
</pre>

The '''docBase''' points to the location of the default theme folder in /usr/share/pki.

= Customization =

To customize the theme, copy the default theme folder into a pki folder in the instance's webapps folder:

 $ cp -r /usr/share/pki/common-ui /var/lib/pki/<font color="red">pki-tomcat</font>/webapps/pki
 $ chown -R pkiuser.pkiuser /var/lib/pki/<font color="red">pki-tomcat</font>/webapps/pki

Then change the '''docBase''' to point to the custom theme folder relative from the webapps folder:

 <Context docBase="pki" crossContext="true" allowLinking="true">
     ...
 </Context>

The change will be effective immediately. There is no need to restart the server. Simply reload the browser to see the changes.

= Removing Custom Theme =

To remove the custom theme simply revert the docBase and delete the custom theme folder:

 $ rm -rf /var/lib/pki/<font color="red">pki-tomcat</font>/webapps/pki
