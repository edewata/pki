What's up?  My name's Andre Richardson, I'm super excited about coming on board for this wiki project! I've been out of work for nearly six months now,<br>and I need to keep up my writing and editing <br>skills, or I won't ever be able to get back into the workforce. I'm looking <br>forward to getting my brain moving again. Since <br>I'm kinda new here, I would seriously appreciate feedback on whatever I might mess up.  I'm sure <br>I'll get it soon.
