== Right now ==

Right now, I'm treating myself for exhausted adrenal glands. <br>This is why PTSD is so fatiguing and can age you. <br>The fear factors work off your adrenal glands, which raise your blood pressure, stress out the heart, and enlarge the vessels in the brain. <br>When the chemicals in the brain are off-balanced long enough [http://indiangrillchicago.com/content/comparateur-prix-chaussures-femme-puma-mostro-cuir-blanc http://indiangrillchicago.com/content/comparateur-prix-chaussures-femme-puma-mostro-cuir-blanc], the serotonin required to help us feel better get low-the reason patients are put on anti-depressants and/or anti-anxiety. <br>This is not good for a long period either because it only masks the symptoms of PTSD. <br>The imbalance will always remain until the victim processes the traumas and makes the connections in their life. <br>I was told that I would be on medication for life if I didn't get therapy [http://www.blindandsons.com/member/21624/ http://www.blindandsons.com/member/21624/], or one year if took therapy. <br>Girlfriend, I ran to the nearest Clinical Psychologist until I could get into the VA therapist.Juanita: Congratulations for getting help Lady. <br> I understand that the feeling of isolation is profound with PTSD sufferers [http://www.send-bulkemail.com/nevils/node/1738 http://www.send-bulkemail.com/nevils/node/1738], and victims of abuse. <br> What was your experience with isolation?Lady:   Our society has denigrated incest and sexual abuse as something as ugly and disgusting as not to be acceptable. <br>Who in their right minds are going to stand up and say, "I have been raped. <br>I'm ugly." The trauma has made us feel ugly on the side inside already. <br>We are not going to help society by pointing ourselves and say, "You're right." In the past, and even to a large degree today, society has forced us to put ugly things in the closet-to hide them. <br>This is isolation in the worst form. <br>No matter how bad we are hurting [http://beta.thevillageoflouisville.org/content/tarif-polo-lacostepolo-lacoste-pas-chere-occasion-nike-lacoste http://beta.thevillageoflouisville.org/content/tarif-polo-lacostepolo-lacoste-pas-chere-occasion-nike-lacoste], we have to keep it ourselves lest others think badly of us [http://partyplasticsplus.com/member/19190/ http://partyplasticsplus.com/member/19190/], or worse, liars.PTSD victims [http://tblol.com/index.php/member/144665/ http://tblol.com/index.php/member/144665/], when in a flashback [http://www.centerlight.org/member/209324 http://www.centerlight.org/member/209324], are not in this reality. <br>We are very much in the other world, which is the past when the trauma occurred. <br>We hear the sounds, smell the odors, feel the physical pain, etc. <br>The PTSD victim has trust issues already [http://www.spencerswinden.com/index.php/member/15203/ http://www.spencerswinden.com/index.php/member/15203/], so their one thought is going to be, "Is anyone going to take advantage of me when I'm not in this reality?" This one, sentence, unuttered but in the back of brain, will force them to be with understanding partners or those of their kind-to isolate themselves from mainstream society.Juanita: Lady, what was your turning point when you realized these were symptoms of PTSD and began your healing process?Lady:  I think my healing process began after an auto accident 4 years prior to the flashback. <br>I impacted the windshield twice from the inside the truck. <br>I was not expected to survive. <br>The accident did take away my smoking habit and my black button (my rage). <br>But I think in the process of trying to get back a lot of the lost memory over the next 2.5 years relaxed my state of being enough for the flashback to push itself to the surface. <br>It had been suppressed for 40 years.Juanita:  Do you think most people have some type of early trauma that may unwittingly be causing problems for them as adults?Lady:  I don't think they do-I know. <br>I can see the problems in body languages [http://furtiv.com/pic/node/5316 http://furtiv.com/pic/node/5316], speech patterns, behaviors... <br>Watching a person for only 30 seconds [http://www.sparkysballoons.com/member/11047/ http://www.sparkysballoons.com/member/11047/], I can tell if they had been traumatized. <br>

== Your business network must have care and attention every sin ==

Your business network must have care and attention every single day.  [http://antica-ferien.ch/index.php/member/21241/ http://antica-ferien.ch/index.php/member/21241/]<br>In my experience, putting the needs of my network first before the needs of my own business has resulted in amazing results. <br>Bob Burg's mentions in his "Endless Referrals" book about Sonia Cooper, an Account Executive with BellSouth Communications who states, "Put the needs of your customers, prospects, and referral sources first...and your paycheck will follow". <br>A great lesson in caring for personal networks and the success that follows when the needs of others are strategically placed before our own.Our goal in business must be to figure out then master the art of creating and building an endless supply of referrals, which originates from multiple sources. <br>Referrals <a href="http://off-de-cannes.com/vip/index.php?p=blogs/viewstory/148730" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">http://off-de-cannes.com/vip/index.php?p=blogs/viewstory/148730</a>, which come from outside your company [http://www.zelkovavc.com/index.php/member/12870/ http://www.zelkovavc.com/index.php/member/12870/], within your company and from all other sources must be the aim of everyone in your organization. <br>In the new world economy, everyone on your team is a salesperson <a href="http://www.s-head.com/verynicejunkie/index.php?p=blogs/viewstory/396744" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">http://www.s-head.com/verynicejunkie/index.php?p=blogs/viewstory/396744</a>, a consultant and in the client service business. <br>Zig Ziglar states [http://drupaltest1.clemson.edu/node/104099 http://drupaltest1.clemson.edu/node/104099], "All of your staff can allow a network to blossom or implode. <br>All members of the team need to respect each other's personal networks." Client services that create an immediate WOW, combined with a feeling of something special will win every time over some striving to aim towards a customer satisfaction rating of satisfied. <br>It is all of our jobs to WOW our network, prospects and clients daily.How does one create a circle of trust and influence that feeds them a bottomless supply of referrals and opportunities? It starts with these seven basic principles:Treat people how they want to be treated - going above the traditional saying of treating people <a href="http://hoanguyettaodan.net/daisanh/entry.php?184-perles-bijoubijou-creationsrd-pour-portablebijou" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: none;">http://hoanguyettaodan.net/daisanh/entry.php?184-perles-bijoubijou-creationsrd-pour-portablebijou</a>, as you want to be treated. <br>It is important to treat people in the manner they want to be cared and give them the attention they deserve. <br>It starts with understanding your client or prospect, putting their needs first and making sure everything your team does is in their best interest. <br>The old saying of "walking a mile in the client's shoes" comes to mind, are we walking in our shoes or the shoes of those whose business we are serving.&emsp;You are not selling - Even if you are in sales, when you are networking, never be selling. <br>Your network is not interested in buying your solutions or products; this must never be your goal. <br>Your goal overtime is to tap into your network's circle of trust and areas of influence. <br>You must build a team of walking and talking ambassadors. <br>When a client of your network colleagues has an issue your solution or product fits [http://mirrormaskfiction.digitalnovelists.com/node/7607 http://mirrormaskfiction.digitalnovelists.com/node/7607], the lead comes to you first and only to you. <br>It is all about creating stickiness with your network, being front of mind. <br>This only comes by being genuine in your business dealings and learning everything you can about those in your network.Save your money - Before you waste another dollar on fancy brochures [http://visitsouth.com/member/21398/ http://visitsouth.com/member/21398/], expensive advertisements and senseless promotions [http://www.nicholassistler.com/index.php/member/167300/ http://www.nicholassistler.com/index.php/member/167300/], develop a referral system. <br>Your referral system must be focused on thanking every single person who passes along your company name [http://fanspage.shamansspark.com/blogs/viewstory/34489 http://fanspage.shamansspark.com/blogs/viewstory/34489], introduces an opportunity to you. <br>
