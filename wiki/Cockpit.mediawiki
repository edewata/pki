<pre>
$ dnf install cockpit

= SSL Certificate =

SSL certificate should be stored in /etc/cockpit/ws-certs.d with a .cert extension.
The file should contain the certificate and its private key.

To check which certificate cockpit-ws will use:

<pre>
$ remotectl certificate
</pre>

See [https://cockpit-project.org/guide/133/https.html#https-certificates Cockpit Certificates].

= SSL Ciphers =

SSL ciphers are defined in /etc/systemd/system/cockpit.service.d/ssl.conf, for example:

<pre>
[Service]
Environment=G_TLS_GNUTLS_PRIORITY=NORMAL:%COMPAT
</pre>

= Authentication =

When running as a container cockpit will establish SSH to the underlying host.

Cockpit can use TLS client certificates for authenticating users.
This requires the host to be in an Identity Management domain like FreeIPA or Active Directory, which can associate certificates to users.
