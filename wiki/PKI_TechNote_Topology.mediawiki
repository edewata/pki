= Deployment Scenarios =

Dogtag Certificate System consists of multiple subsystems and they can be connected in different fashion. We will discuss some scenarios here.

Note that all connection between subsystems are SSL-protected.

== RA ==

This is a very simple setup. The registration authority (RA) is running outside of the firewall. It will be the main interface to interact with the users.

== Key Archival ==

A DRM subsystem can be setup behind a CA. When the CA receives a CRMF request with the archival option, it will forward the request to DRM for key archival.

== Cloned Subsystem ==

To avoid single point of failure, you can clone a subsystem. A cloned subsystem requires a new LDAP instance which will have multi-master replication setup with the master LDAP instance. The subsystem itself supports multiple failover connections.

== Token Management ==

In this token management setup, TPS is running outside of the firewall, and it interfaces with ESC directly.
